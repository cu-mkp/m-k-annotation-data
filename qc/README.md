- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress reporting with intermediate saves
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Detailed output with actionable categorized results

**Usage:**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

# Run the checker
python check_broken_links.py

## Best Practices

### Running Quality Control Checks

1. **Regular Monitoring:** Run broken link checks regularly, especially after content updates
2. **Environment Isolation:** Always use the virtual environment to ensure consistent results
3. **Resource Respect:** The tools implement rate limiting - avoid bypassing these safeguards
4. **Progress Tracking:** Monitor progress through console output and intermediate report files
5. **Result Analysis:** Review categorized results to prioritize fixes (definitely broken vs. potentially working)

### Interpreting Results

- **403 Forbidden:** Often academic paywalls or authentication-required sites
- **404 Not Found:** Genuinely missing pages or moved content
- **DNS Failures:** Dead domains or network connectivity issues
- **Timeout Errors:** Slow or unresponsive servers
- **406 Not Acceptable:** May work in browsers despite automation failure

### Maintenance

- **Dependencies:** Keep Python packages updated for security and compatibility
- **Virtual Environment:** Recreate venv periodically to ensure clean environment
- **Log Rotation:** Archive old log files to prevent disk space issues
- **Report Analysis:** Regular review of QC reports to identify patterns and trends

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Virtual Environment Issues:**
   ```bash
   # Recreate virtual environment
   rm -rf venv
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. **Network Connectivity:**
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify DNS resolution

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Script implements automatic rate limiting
   - If blocked, wait before retrying
   - Consider adjusting delays in script configuration

4. **Memory Issues:**
   - For large datasets, monitor system memory
   - Consider processing in smaller batches
   - Close other applications if needed

### Support

For issues with QC tools:
1. Check log files for detailed error information
2. Verify all dependencies are properly installed
3. Ensure virtual environment is activated
4. Review network connectivity and permissions

## Development

### Contributing

When modifying QC tools:
1. Test changes in isolated environment
2. Update documentation for new features
3. Add appropriate error handling
4. Include progress reporting for long-running operations
5. Respect rate limiting and server resources

### Configuration

Key configuration parameters in `check_broken_links.py`:
- `batch_size`: Number of URLs per batch (default: 20)
- `max_workers`: Concurrent worker threads (default: 4)
- `timeout`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 10)
- Domain-specific delays in `get_domain_delay()` function

Adjust these values based on:
- Available system resources
- Network bandwidth
- Target server responsiveness
- Desired balance between speed and politeness
