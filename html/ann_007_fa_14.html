<p><span dir="ltr">From the number of references in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 and contemporary sources, sulfur appears to have been a versatile material in early modern fabrication processes. The manuscript refers several times to sulfur as a material for casting, and this essay will focus on these recipes. Our primary question is why, and under what circumstances, sulfur would be an advantageous material to use for pouring and molding. Our method of inquiry in addressing this question is to examine the material properties of sulfur itself when melted and poured into molds, as well as to follow the manuscript’s directions for additives to sulfur in order to test their effects on the casting process. In addition to our questions regarding why and when sulfur would have been used for casting, and what sulfur would be mixed with and why, these experiments and this research aims to address whether the material of sulfur itself carried any semiotic meaning for the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640, and whether the material properties of sulfur (e.g., flammability and brittleness) are significant in the author-practitioner’s descriptions or directions. This research essay begins by reading closely some of the directions that the manuscript gives for casting in sulfur. It then proceeds to describe the series of experiments we performed, to discuss the textual sources in combination with experimental findings, and to conclude with suggestions for further research.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">To answer our questions, we will focus on two recipes that explicitly discuss casting in sulfur: fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><span class="underline">140v</span></a>, “For casting in sulfur,” and fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12r/f/12r/tl"><span class="underline">12r</span></a>, “For molding sulfur.”</span></p>
<h2 id="text-of-the-recipes"><span dir="ltr"><br>
Text of the Recipes</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The recipe “For casting in sulfur” on fol. 140v emphasises neatness (<em>net, nettement</em>), suggesting that obtaining a smooth surface in molding and casting was a significant criterion of success. This is further illustrated by a marginal note which reads “try sulfur passed through melted wax, because it no longer inflames &amp; no longer makes eyelets.” The phrase “passed through” is unclear, but could mean melting the wax first and adding the solid sulfur subsequently, since the recipe seems to emphasize that the wax is already melted. The “eyelets” mentioned here may refer to air bubbles that form within the heated material, which can damage an otherwise well-poured cast, hence affecting its smooth surface.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Another criterion is that the cast object may be easily removed from the mold, which may also be one of the connotations of the author-practitioner’s use of the word <em>net</em>.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> “For molding sulfur” [<em>Pour mouler de soufre</em>] on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12r/f/12r/tl"><span class="underline">12r</span></a> includes similar emphasis on casting “very neatly” avoiding “pustules &amp; bubbles”—notably, one should not “cast in wind &amp; in cold, for it would become porous.” Sulfur is improved by mixing in “soot black” or “pulverized sanguine,” which makes it “harder and stronger.” As described in Cennino Cennini’s <em>The Craftsman’s Handbook</em>, “soot black” is the soot collected from a lamp burning linseed oil.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Cennini also provides an explanation of “sanguine”: “mark out all the outlines with dark sinoper and a little black, tempered; and this will be called ‘sanguine.’”</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">What Cennini means by “dark sinoper” is not entirely clear. In fact, Cennini’s translator uses the term as an example of a word with a diffuse meaning which is difficult to translate: “in other cases, such as his [Cennini’s term] <em>sinopia</em>, the meaning is too general to be reduced to any single commercial term.”</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Vannoccio Biringuccio mentions a similar mixture of sulfur and red powder: “when I did not have plaster of Paris, I have used sulfur and brick dust.”</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Cennini, too, recommends casting with sulfur, using clay or plaster molds: “if you wish to cast medals…, melt some sulfur; get it cast in these molds, and it will be done.”</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The suggestion that mixing sulfur with these pigments would it “harder and more resistant” or “tougher and stronger” implies that, since sulfur itself is quite brittle and chips or cracks easily, hardening the pigments might have enhanced their durability, and thus their usefulness.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The marginal note on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/12r/f/12r/tl"><span class="underline">12r</span></a> contains several interesting modifications to the main recipe. In particular, two other sets of terms, besides the “eyelets” from fol. 140v, are used to caution against air bubbles: “pustules &amp; bubbles,” (<em>pustules &amp; bouillons</em>) and the verb <em>souffler</em> which here means to “become porous.” The author-practitioner’s use of three different terms for bubble-like imperfections, each with slightly different connotations, speaks to a material awareness of the process which is not immediately clear to the modern reader.</span></p>

<h2 id="experiments"><span dir="ltr">Experiments</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">In order to test some of our hypotheses and to decipher some of the more cryptic language in the two recipes from Ms. Fr. 640, we first focused our experiments on casting pure sulfur into bread, as suggested on fol. 140v. Later, in order to save time, we used a standardized silicone baking mold. Then we moved on to casting sulfur with some of the pigments added, as suggested on fol. 12r, and to casting sulfur in combination with wax, as in fol. 140v. For our first experiment, using bread as a molding material, we patiently grew a rye yeast starter, which eventually yielded a dark and dense rye bread.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">After removing the bread from the oven, we scooped the pith of the bread out from the crust with a spoon while the bread was still hot, and pressed it in two big pieces around the sides (front and back) of a small Buddha figurine. When dry, this was our pattern for molding (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">We pierced the bread with two wooden lead pencils as indications of how to register the two sides of the mold with respect to one another, and we cut a gate into which the molten casting material could be poured. The 99.9% pure sulfur that we used came as a bright yellow powder. The material’s melting point is about 240°F, and it took around thirty minutes to solidify inside our bread mold (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>). The result of our pour was a highly detailed, three-dimensional reproduction of the figurine, reproducing more of the surface detail of the original than the bread mold appeared to have captured, as detail in the uniformly dark color of the bread is difficult to see (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>). The success of this experiment informed our subsequent trials. Because this was a two-sided mold, no surface of the sulfur was exposed to air, which seems to have guaranteed the relatively smooth surface; in the one-sided bread molds created by other members of our group, the crystals of the sulfur became quite visible as the sulfur cooled.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_007_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDaUgtQ2J1S3Jldk0.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 1: Bread mold of a Buddha figurine, Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen, Making and Knowing Lab, 2014.

<p><span dir="ltr">The cast of the Buddha figurine demonstrated that pure sulfur melts easily, pours well, and picks up very detailed impressions of molds. Other pours of pure sulfur executed by the rest of the group corroborated the results of this experiment. Our next trials involved mixing sulfur with soot black in varying amounts.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Few of the recipes that we considered included amounts or proportions; this left the measurements of our experiments open to question.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">We also experimented with the order of steps in the process: melting the sulfur and adding the pigment afterward, mixing them as powders and melting them together, and melting them separately and mixing them afterward (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The pigment was quite potent, and two very small spoonfuls (less than 2g) added to 11.5g of sulfur turned the mixture a rich, dark black color (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 9</span></i>). A smaller amount of soot black added to the same amount of sulfur still gave the melted mixture a dark black color, but when it hardened the difference became apparent: the first mixture with the larger amount of black turned dark gray, whereas the smaller amount made the casts turn a greenish color (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 10</span></i>). The color of all mixtures lightened over time. When we first poured them, all the casts looked much darker than they became after they completely solidified (<i><span class="underline">Vid. 1</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_007_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDNUcyTDViMXJQQ1U.jpg" alt="fig. 4"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 4: Powdered sulfur and soot black, Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen, Making and Knowing Lab, 2014.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_007_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDYzNsR0lZZjhvSE0.jpg" alt="fig. 5"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 5: Powdered sulfur and soot black beginning to melt, Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen, Making and Knowing Lab, 2014.

<p><span dir="ltr">Our other experiments with pigments were much less successful. For “sanguine” we mixed a Venetian red pigment (also from Kremer Pigments, used for our “sinoper”) with a very small amount of lamp black, as per Cennini’s instructions (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 12</span></i>). When combined with the sulfur, the powders appeared to form a homogeneous mix, but after we poured the mixture, the materials visibly separated from one another, so that the poured cast was dappled yellow and red (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 13</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 14</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_007_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDbHlrbmFxb1BzVTA.jpg" alt="fig. 11"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 11: Powdered sulfur with sanguine, Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen, Making and Knowing Lab, 2014.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_007_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDZXoxalVwUXVhVnM.jpg" alt="fig. 12"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 12: Mixed powdered sulfur and sanguine, Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen, Making and Knowing Lab, 2014. 11.5g of powdered sulfur mixed with a small spoon of Venetian Red pigment and a trace amount of soot black.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_007_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDREhYaVpMUU9maXM.jpg" alt="fig. 13"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 13: Sulfur and sanguine casts.

<p> <span dir="ltr">We began our experiments with sulfur and wax with similar doubts about how well the materials would mix, because in earlier trials with bread molding, other group members found the ingredients did not combine well. The line from fol. 140v, “try sulfur passed through melted wax” could, once again, imply a number of procedures, and we attempted several: melting wax then adding powdered sulfur, melting wax then adding solid sulfur (in chunks), and melting each separately and combining them. The different forms of the sulfur appeared not to affect the results of these experiments. When sulfur, in either a solid or molten liquid state, was combined with wax, the two materials remained visibly separate, reminiscent of oil added to water (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 15</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_007_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDb0RtYVlSM0Z3Yms.jpg" alt="fig. 15"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 15: Molten sulfur with wax, Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen, Making and Knowing Lab, 2014.

The two remained separate.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">For carrying out these experiments another recipe from the manuscript was useful, “Wax for molding” on fol. 109r, in particular the phrase “and with the sulfur going to the bottom…,” since this implies precisely that the sulfur and the wax do <em>not</em> mix or fuse. Instead, the sulfur turned a reddish color at the bottom of the liquid wax. We now felt we understood that this is what the author-practitioner meant in reporting that the sulfur should be “passed through” the wax. The results of these pours in which we passed the sulfur through the wax were very smooth, milky, homogeneous surfaces, with a large amount of detail. They had all the definition of sulfur casts but appeared less brittle, and they also contained all the malleability of wax, without its translucency (a characteristic that makes it difficult to see detail on wax impressions and therefore makes them more challenging to work with (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 16</span></i>). Furthermore, the back sides of these sulfur-wax casts did not crystallize visibly in the way that pure sulfur or sulfur mixed with pigments did; instead, the back surface that was exposed to the air was as smooth as the front (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 17</span></i>). Our final experiment with sulfur and wax was to melt one of these mixtures back to a liquid state. As predicted, they gradually re-separated (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 18</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 19</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_007_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDTW5qUFQxX1lqNVk.jpg" alt="fig. 16"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 16: Spectrum of casts from pure sulfur to pure wax, Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen, Making and Knowing Lab, 2014. In the procedure for combining wax and sulfur the two materials remained largely separate, and therefore each pour has a slightly varying ratio of the two materials. All of them appeared to be mostly composed of wax (with sulfur remaining at the bottom of the melting pot). All of our trials began with the same amount (by weight) of wax and sulfur. From right to left, these four casts are: pure wax; a first pour (mostly wax); a second pour (a slightly larger amount of sulfur); and pure sulfur. Note the harsh luster of the pure sulfur and the translucency of the wax. The two ‘medals’ in the middle both have a great amount of visible detail without the brittleness of the sulfur.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_007_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDTFRGYlRiUDhnaHM.jpg" alt="fig. 17"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 17: Mixture of sulfur and wax in silicone molds, Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen, Making and Knowing Lab, 2014.

<h2 id="open-questions-and-conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Open Questions and Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Further experiments involving sulfur and its additives would include a study of and experiments with all of the recipes that mention sulfur in the manuscript, although that may be difficult to achieve. The most common combinations, aside from sulfur with wax, include the addition of metal filings (copper and iron), tin, ammonia salt, resin, and verdigris. Additionally, further trials with other pigments for “sanguine” besides the Venetian red pigment that we used would help to determine the author-practitioner’s meaning in that suggestion. Along similar lines, the proportions of the various materials could be explored in more depth; we only had time to test proportions within a relatively small range. Further philological or hermeneutic research into the author-practitioner’s use of language might also help to determine the actual ends of casting in sulfur, and why making the material “harder and stronger” was a valuable goal. Additionally, while empirical observations seemed to corroborate the author-practitioner’s comments about the hardness and brittleness of the various mixtures, more accurate testing with appropriate instruments would provide interesting insight.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While very few positive conclusions can be drawn from either these experiments or the text of the recipes, we can say with certainty that sulfur was used as a casting material for good reason, since its capacity for accepting detail proved excellent in almost all experiments. Whatever alchemical associations the material carried for others—Biringuccio mentions these properties and practitioners skeptically</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a><span dir="ltr">—few traces of those ideas are evident in the recipes from Ms. Fr. 640 that we studied. Instead, sulfur is used quite practically, and when its deficiencies as a material (its color, luster, or brittleness) make it inappropriate for certain tasks, the author suggests augmenting it with other materials. That sulfur is also used in so many other ways, including as an ingredient in pigments and in a variety of other recipes, attests not only to the material’s availability and versatility, but perhaps more significantly, to its <em>perceived</em> versatility.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">For all of the different uses documented, one can infer that others were tried but did not produce the desired result. Therefore it may not be too speculative to suggest that sulfur metonymically represents the process of trying and assaying, or in other words, of “experimenting” itself. The prevalence of sulfur in recipes ranging from coloring to casting to “boiling an egg in cold water without fire” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/35r/f/35r/tl"><span class="underline">35r</span></a>) provides evidence that the material was both commonly used and tried in a breadth of applications. Even in its uses in casting explored here, one of its purposes was likely to experiment with the level of detail one can achieve with a carved pattern or mold.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It would seem that, in its ubiquity in trying and testing in this manuscript, sulfur both connoted the idea of experimentation and, as a versatile material, invited further actual trials.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Although sulfur, along with mercury and sometimes salt, was considered by alchemical writers to be one of the “principles” of all metals, and is therefore ubiquitous in discussions of that subject, such ideas are not explicitly discussed in Ms. Fr. 640.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Lawrence M. Principe criticizes Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer for claiming that alchemical experiments were not rigorous and repeatable.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Whatever the author-practitioner’s relationship to alchemy was, our research and experimentation has demonstrated that the claims made in regard to casting sulfur in BnF. Ms. Fr. 640 <em>are</em> repeatable. Addressing the reproducibility of alchemical practices would be beyond the scope of the present study, but we have been able to conclude that the author-practitioner provides practical—and practicable—advice on procedures for casting using sulfur.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> Our research has only been able to raise the question as to whether the author-practitioner omitted mentioning sulfur’s applications to alchemical processes simply because those uses were so widespread as to be common knowledge, or whether these omissions constitute evidence of a more deliberate disinterest in chrysopoetic alchemy (as displayed by Biringuccio). Further research would be necessary to determine what allusions to alchemy exist in the manuscript. Nonetheless, based on the number and variety of recipes that suggest using sulfur (and, presumably, others that were not included) our work with sulfur allows us to conclude that the author-practitioner’s methods were not only predicated on experimentation, but that for him sulfur seemed metonymically to stand for the process of experimentation.</span></p>

<li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">Biringuccio writes on the uses of sulfur for casting and more broadly: “as I told you, sulfur melts and by means of its fusion one can mold any desired object from it as if it were plaster of Paris, wax, or melted metal. It serves human needs in medicine, in the purifying and bleaching of wool, and in divers other things. But the greatest quantity today is consumed in making gunpowder.” See Vannoccio Biringuccio, <em>The Pirotechnia of Vannoccio Biringuccio: The Classic Sixteenth-Century Treatise on Metals and Metallurgy</em>, trans. Cyril Stanley Smith and Martha Teach Gnudi (New York: Dover Publications, 1990), 90.</span><a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">“There is another black which is made in this manner: take a lamp full of linseed oil, and fill the lamp with this oil, and light the lamp. Then put it, so lighted, underneath a good clean baking dish, and have the little flame of the lamp come about to the bottom of the dish, two or three fingers away, and the smoke which comes out of the flame will strike on the bottom of the dish, and condense in as mass. Wait a while; take the baking dish, and with some implement sweep this color, that is, soot, off on to a paper, or into some dish; and it does not have to be worked up or ground, for it is a very fine color.” Cennino d’Andrea Cennini, <em>The Craftsman’s Handbook: “Il Libro dell’Arte”</em>, trans. Daniel V. Thompson, Jr. (New York: Dover Publications, 1960), 22–23. Also peripherally relevant is the “black sulfured wax” recommended on fol. 139v. Cellini also mentions using “black wax”: “to see better how you are getting on, you may occasionally press in a little black wax, or whatever colour pleases you better, to gauge the projections.” See <em>The Treatises</em>, 65. Cellini does not describe how to make “black wax,” but the recipe “Casting Wax to mold an animal that one has not got,” Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 139v, includes a definition of black wax that contains charcoal.</span><a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

He continues: “to translate <em>sinopia</em>, ‘Venetian red,’ would be to fix arbitrarily upon one of many perfectly good reds, all of which Cennini would unhesitatingly have called <em>sinopia</em>; and that to no good purpose, for there are almost as many shades of Venetian red in modern trade as there are colormen who sell that universal pigment.” <em>The Craftsman’s Handbook</em>, xiv–xv.

<li id="fn14" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">On pp. 86–87 of <em>The Pirotechnia</em>, Biringuccio doubts that sulfur is a “principle” for metals, as the alchemists argued, “because I do not believe that either of these [mercury or sulfur] really occurs except in similar elemental substances. I say this because I have never seen sulfur found in any metal mine, or metal near any sulfur or mercury ore,” yet he proceeds, “the alchemists hold sulfur in great reverence as a material agent in all their operations because of its heat and dryness and because of its yellow color.” He then describes silk workers’ use of the material for bleaching and women’s use of it as a hair dye.

<li id="fn15" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">Sulfur was also a readily available material, as evidenced in numerous inventories from sixteenth-century Europe, where it is referenced in different colors and forms, including yellow and grey, in cakes or as a paste, gathered from volcanic regions. See inventories in Jo Kirby, Susie Nash and Joanna Cannon, eds., <em>Trade in Artists’ Materials: Markets and Commerce in Europe to 1700</em> (London: Archetype Publications, 2010), 258 (inventory of Venetian color seller Jacopo d’ Benedetti), 351 (in the stock of the English storekeeper William Watkyns), and <em>passim</em> (in the large scale vermillion making carried out in several European centers).</span><a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn18" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">Shapin and Schaffer characterize the difference between “The experimental ‘laboratory’” and “the alchemist’s closet in that the former was said to be a public and the latter a private space.” Shapin and Schaffer, <em>Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), 57. Principe does not appear to object to their argument regarding public, as opposed to private, experimentation. See Principe, “Apparatus and Reproducibility in Alchemy,” in <em>Instruments and Experimentation in the History of Chemistry</em>, ed. Frederic L. Holmes and Trevor H. Levere (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2000), 56. Whether the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 practiced his experiments in public or private settings is not an answerable question at this stage of research, but the fact that the manuscript exists is at least one form of making the author’s work available outside of his workshop, whatever that space may have been.</span><a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
