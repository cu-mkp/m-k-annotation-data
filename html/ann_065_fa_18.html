<p><span dir="ltr">Aquafortis, or “strong water,” has been commonly interpreted by historians to mean nitric acid. In fact, the term “aqua” was used in the medieval and early modern period to denote any kind of liquid; thus the meaning of aquafortis is often ambiguous, and does not solely denote nitric acid, as this essay makes clear.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Aquafortis eludes precise categorization due to its variety of uses, as well as the variety of recipes for making it.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Numerous entries in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 require the use of aquafortis (<em>eau fort</em>). These include “Color of damascene steel on knives” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><span class="underline">11v</span></a>) which describes rubbing steel with aquafortis mixed with clay; recipes “For eating away and dissolving entirely pure gold” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104r/f/104r/tl"><span class="underline">104r</span></a>) and “Augmenting the color of gold” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166v/f/166v/tl"><span class="underline">166v</span></a>); “Very light and hollow work of gold,” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156r/f/156r/tl"><span class="underline">156r</span></a>), in which the aquafortis should “eat away” silver, but leave pure gold unharmed; and even as a suggestion for how <em>not</em> to kill “snakes for molding” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><span class="underline">109v</span></a>). The use of aquafortis was common in the laboratory of the medieval and early modern alchemist, as well as in the workshops of many practitioners working with metals.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">On fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><span class="underline">75r</span></a>, the author-practitioner includes a recipe for aquafortis, which instructs to “take a half-septier of vinegar with one ounce of verdigris, &amp; one ounce of copperas &amp; one ounce of solle, then put them together in a glass vial.” The point of departure for this essay is an investigation of the materials contained in this aquafortis recipe by comparison with other contemporary sources. These include alchemical manuscripts, books of secrets, and metallurgical treatises, which reveal a wide variety of recipes, uses, and literary genres that incorporated recipes for aquafortis. By placing the recipe within a broader historical context, we can make better sense of aquafortis and its ingredients in the manuscript and enrich our understanding of the manuscript as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The second part of the essay describes the reconstruction of the recipe for aquafortis in the manuscript. In order to determine the efficacy of the recipe, the reconstruction connects with other entries in the manuscript. “Color of damascene steel on knives” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><span class="underline">11v</span></a>) in particular provides an internal reference to test the reconstructed aquafortis. It describes the application of aquafortis on steel, allowing us to assess the qualities of different kinds of aquafortis through their effects in comparison with their presumed purpose.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The recipe for aquafortis on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><span class="underline">75r</span></a> requires a demi-septier of vinegar, an ounce of copperas, verdigris and <em>solle</em>. These materials raise several questions both independently and in relation to one another. What the author-practitioner refers to as “copperas,” for example, is ambiguous, and the meaning of the word <em>solle</em>, which does not repeat again in the manuscript, is unclear. Other ingredients such as saltpeter, common in the making of aquafortis, are missing. Furthermore, the interactions between these materials raise the question of what the resulting aquafortis is. No less a matter for investigation are the units of measure the author-practitioner used in the recipe.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">As units of measure varied regionally, and even within regions, during the ancien régime, the meaning of the measures “demi-septier” (<em>demy sestier</em>) and “ounce” (<em>once</em>) on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><span class="underline">75r</span></a> pose a difficulty.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The units that came into use in the French-speaking regions of Europe were derived from the Roman Imperial system of <em>once</em> and <em>livre,</em> translated into <em>setier</em> and <em>muid</em>.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The setier was used both in liquid and solid measurements, which were traditionally separated due to the difference in weight between water and grains of the same volume.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Contemporary practitioners were aware that this could be a problem. For example, Vannoccio Biringuccio, in his <em>De la pirotechnia</em> (1540), admonishes his readers to adjust their weights and measures to the local custom.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The distinction between <em>septier</em> and <em>demi-septier</em> is made clear in Randle Cotgrave’s <em>Dictionary of the French and English Tongues</em> (1611) where <em>septier</em> is given as the equivalent of eight Parisian <em>pintes</em>.</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The <em>demi-septier de vin</em> was not, however, half of a <em>septier</em> as its name suggests. As Cotgrave further explains, the <em>demi-septier</em> <em>de vin</em> is equivalent to half a <em>chopine</em>, which in turn is a Parisian half-pint, meaning that the <em>demi-setier</em> is roughly 250ml.</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The oldest known recipes for aquafortis can be found in the <em>Liber fornacum</em> and in the <em>Liber de inventione veritatis</em> which survive in thirteenth-century Latin manuscripts from Italy.</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a><span dir="ltr">These texts contain a variety of recipes which have been understood to produce nitric acid.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> They refer to aquafortis as <em>aqua nostra dissolutiva</em> (“our dissolving water”), reflecting its properties as a dissolving substance.</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">These recipes, however, differ markedly from the author-practitioner’s instructions. The <em>Liber fornacum</em> and <em>Liber de inventione veritatis</em> provide not only the first written recipes for aquafortis but also a practical context.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">A recipe from the <em>Liber fornacum</em>, understood to produce nitric acid, includes instructions to distil one pound of red mercury mixed with one pound of saltpeter and one pound of vitriol.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The recipe in the <em>Liber de inventione veritatis</em> calls for distilling one pound of vitriol of cyprus mixed with half a pound of saltpeter and a quarter pound of alum.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Here, vitriol of cyprus refers to copper(II) sulfate, also known as blue vitriol for its blue color, and famously found in rich copper mines in Cyprus.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This last recipe for “water that can dissolve” metals can be made even “stronger” by adding sal ammoniac.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Nonetheless, variations of aquafortis made with alum (often a substitute for vitriol) and red mercury (most likely referring to mercury oxide, HgO, which produces a dry red powder) were less common. The two other ingredients—saltpeter and vitriol—were far more common in many subsequent recipes for aquafortis, though saltpeter is not used in the recipe on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><span class="underline">75r</span></a>.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The recipe for aquafortis in the <em>Liber de inventione veritatis</em> is comparable to another recipe in the <em>Liber fornacum</em>. The recipe in the <em>Liber fornacum</em> instructs to distil “filings of Venus” (copper(II) sulfate) with common salt and calcined alum in vinegar.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Both the “filings of Venus” and an alternative, “filings from Mars,” are found in the <em>Liber de inventione veritatis</em>, where they refer to copper(II) sulfate (Venus) and iron sulfate (Mars), both of which are called vitriols. These two compounds in the <em>Liber fornacum</em> recipe provide important clues for our understanding of the materials in the recipe for aquafortis on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><span class="underline">75r</span></a> in Ms. Fr. 640.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The use of salt and the absence of saltpeter, as in the entry in Ms. Fr. 640, fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75v/f/75v/tl"><span class="underline">75v</span></a>, occurs in a variety of other sources, such as in Georgius Agricola’s <em>De re metallica</em> (1556), a treatise on mining and metallurgy which emphasizes direct observation and experience in combination with ancient sources.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In the tenth book of <em>De re metallica</em>, Agricola outlines numerous recipes for <em>aqua valens</em> (“vigorous water”), distilled for the purpose of parting gold and silver. In the first recipe, “the use of which is common and general, there is one libra of vitriol and as much salt, added to a third of a libra of spring water.”</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This chemical mixture would, in fact, not produce nitric acid, but rather hydrochloric acid, due to the lack of saltpeter.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Another recipe for aquafortis in <em>De re metallica</em> differentiates saltpeter from salt and “contains two librae of powder of baked bricks, one libra of vitriol, likewise one libra of saltpetre, a handful of salt, and three-quarters of a libra of spring water.”</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">These two recipes, one containing only salt and the other including saltpeter, confirm that “salt” did not necessarily mean “saltpeter” in aquafortis recipes such as the one in Ms. Fr. 640. Furthermore, the different solutions produced in the process of distillation allow us to begin to see how aquafortis did not refer to any one specific chemical compound.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Biringuccio discusses the distillation of aquafortis and also proposes a recipe for an <em>aqua acuta</em> (“acute water”)—an acid for parting gold and silver that calls for one part well-refined saltpeter and three times as much well-washed rock alum.</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">He adds that some recipes might vary the quantities of the saltpeter, or add vitriol or arsenic, and alchemists might even add salt.</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">These ingredients are distilled, and the process of distillation as well as the workings of an alembic (a device with two vessels for distillation) are all outlined, similar to the entry in the tenth book of <em>De re metallica</em>.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Agricola’s vitriol requirement is ambiguous. Vitriols were mainly distinguished according to their colors: the green powder of iron(II) sulfate gained the name green vitriol, the blue powder of copper(II) sulfate was labeled blue vitriol, and the white powder of zinc sulfate was called white vitriol.</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Biringuccio establishes these very same color divisions for vitriols in <em>Pirotechnia</em> and defines vitriol as a mineral substance found in sulphur and used to make oils and corrosive acids.</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">He distinguishes between those vitriols he mentions in the chapter “concerning vitriol and its ore” and a vitriol “found reduced to its ultimate purity by Nature herself without art. This is a very powerful vitriol and is not called vitriol but copperas.”</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Copperas, according to Biringuccio, is therefore a type of vitriol in pure form, bringing us closer to the meaning of copperas in Ms. Fr. 640.</span><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner himself makes a similar distinction in “A way for molding excellently with water” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83v/f/83v/tl"><span class="underline">83v</span></a>), in which he writes “do the same with vitriol &amp; copperas, which, once well calcined, reduce in water,” thereby differentiating vitriol and copperas but employing the two substances for the same purpose. Whether he meant them as overlapping terms or whether he conceived of copperas as being clearly distinct from other vitriols remains unclear. It seems that when the type of sulfate is pertinent, the type of vitriol is directly mentioned. The author-practitioner does this in the recipe for “For making water for disease of the eyes” that calls for “white copperas” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79r/f/79r/tl"><span class="underline">79r</span></a>), which we can now understand as zinc sulfate.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Vitriols were used in many different contexts, one of which is mentioned in a manuscript compiled by Friar Giovanni Andrea in 1562 in Lucca, titled <em>Libro dei Secreti e Ricette</em> (Book of secrets and recipes), also known as the “Gesuatti Manuscript.”</span><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The manuscript, featuring about 400 pages of remedies, illustrates the method of preparation of oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid) used in several of the remedies, noting that the starting material is <em>vitriolo romano</em>, which can be identified as copper(II) sulfate.</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Equally interesting is the description of oil of vitriol being composed of the two Aristotelian elements, water and fire, since it was a liquid that burned things.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">However, complicating the positive identification of Roman vitriol is a sixteenth- or seventeenth-century Hebrew manuscript that provides a recipe for solidifying quicksilver, in which, it has been suggested, Roman vitriol can be identified as iron(II) sulfate.</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">A fourteenth-century manuscript from Bologna contains two recipes that shed more light on the use of vitriols in recipes for aquafortis. The first, for <em>aqua corrosiva</em> (“corrosive water”), notes that aquafortis “reduces the weight of the body brought about from the salt of ammonium (saltpeter) and of copperas in equal proportions [when] distilled in still water.” The second, for <em>aqua solvens</em> (“dissolving water”) to dissolve “silver and indeed other metals,” is made from “<em>vitriollo romano</em> and saltpeter in equal parts, and this water dissolves iron.”</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The two recipes from the Bologna manuscript describe the use of two sulfates, <em>vitriollo romano</em> and <em>coperosa</em>, in two different recipes for aquafortis.</span><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">According to Biringuccio, Roman vitriol “is not well vitrified and clear and is not of the same lovely blue-green color” as Cyprian vitriol and that it is “blackest, most beautiful, and the best,” with the exception of Massa vitriol.</span><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Nonetheless, Biringuccio indicates that both Roman vitriol and Cyprian vitriol (and Massa vitriol) are comparable and were used by alchemists to make strong corrosive acids.</span><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The ambiguous nature of the term Roman vitriol in the early modern period stresses the importance of the indication of the color of the vitriol. This might indicate that by omitting the type of vitriol needed in the recipe, the author-practitioner was not assuming tacit knowledge but allowing the reader to choose from the vitriols available since any of them would work.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Roman vitriol is also mentioned in a recipe for aquafortis in Benvenuto Cellini’s <em>Treatises on Goldsmithing and Sculpture</em> published in 1568.</span><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Cellini instructs his reader to take “8 pounds of burnt rock alum, an equal quantity of the best saltpeter, and 4 pounds of Roman vitriol, and put them together in an alembic.”</span><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The recipe closely follows the one found in Biringuccio’s <em>Pirotechnia</em>, but adds Roman vitriol. Biringuccio mentions that some prefer to add Roman vitriol to aquafortis, further highlighting the diversity of recipes and the difficulty in defining aquafortis in terms of chemical composition.</span><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">As this overview of recipes shows, aquafortis could be many things and made of many different ingredients. The author practitioner seems to have been aware of this: in a recipe for “Augmenting the Color of Gold” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166v/f/166v/tl"><span class="underline">166v</span></a>), he specifically recommends using “aquafortis of vitriol,” suggesting that he was aware of the different varieties of aquafortis, and perhaps even of the employment of different recipes for different uses.</span><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The entry on fol. 166v resembles another recipe for a similar purpose prescribing aquafortis. Leonardo da Vinci’s <em>Codex Atalanticus</em> (c. 1480) provides a recipe for “tinging works of gold,” with instructions to put vitriol, verdigris and saltpeter in a crucible with the object one wants to tinge.</span><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The process is similar to the entry in Ms. Fr. 640, which says to heat aquafortis of vitriol and to “cover the bottle, that is to say, the mouth, with a tile, then unstop it &amp; thick fumes will come out; put the gold on this and it will take on a high color” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166v/f/166v/tl"><span class="underline">166v</span></a>).</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">William Newman points out that a similar recipe is given in an alchemical manuscript by a fifteenth-century Neapolitan printer named Arnaldus de Bruxella, thus further widening the scope and geographic expanse through which we can begin to understand Ms. Fr. 640.</span><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The manuscript written by Arnaldus is a compendium of practical recipes for metalwork and glass making, alongside theoretical discussions.</span><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">William Jerome Wilson observes that within the context of Arnaldus’s manuscript there is no general term for liquids, and the word “water” (aqua) stands in for any liquid, while “aquafortis” stands for any liquid that has the particular ability to dissolve and interact with solids.</span><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Arnaldus’s manuscript (f. 74b–f. 76a) provides a recipe “to make aqua fortis and the virtues of it, (things) which can be performed with it.”</span><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The recipe for aquafortis in Arnaldus requires “vitriol, sal nitrum (saltpeter), and cinnabar,” to be ground and put together in a distillery, and lists one of its virtues as “coloring silver as gold.”</span><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Among the virtues of aquafortis in Arnaldus’s manuscript was its use for “the killing of an animal.”</span><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner also includes a recipe for “killing snakes for molding,” stating, however, that it is not effective:</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">some put a drop of aquafortis in the mouth, that which stuns them well, such that the head &amp; the part behind seem to be dead, but the mouth remains alive, and when you pierce it with a needle to fit it to the mold, it moves &amp; spoils &amp; undoes everything. Therefore, to put them to death entirely, put it in a bottle of good vinegar &amp; some eau-de-vie. And do thus with lizards &amp; other similar beasts (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><span class="underline">109v</span></a>).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner, in contradicting Arnaldus by suggesting not to use aquafortis for this purpose, provides advice seemingly rooted in experience and relevant to a specific artisanal purpose: molding snakes.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="application-of-aquafortis-on-metal"><span dir="ltr">Application of Aquafortis on Metal</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The uses of aquafortis thus ranged widely, as can also be seen in Ms. Fr. 640.</span><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">An entry in Arnaldus on fol. 109b to enrich the color of gold calls for a paste made of “vitriol, sal armoniac, verdetto, and <em>alumen gonci</em>, distempered with strong red vinegar.”</span><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This paste is to be applied to gold, which is then placed on glowing coals; the process should allow a reaction with the fumes produced from the paste, enriching the surface of the alloy, similar to the process and recipe provided by da Vinci.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The <em>Summa perfectionis</em> provides another interesting example of a paste used to enrich or purify gold (or at least its surface). The recipe includes instructions to mix vitriol, sal ammoniac, “and other sharp penetrating substances, and make a paste and spread this upon the thin plates of the metal; lay them on the iron grating in a closed earthen vessel over a fire.”</span><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The many similarities this recipe has with those mentioned above connect it to the entry in Ms. Fr. 640 for “Color of Damascene Steel on Knives” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><span class="underline">11v</span></a>) in its mode of application of the sharp paste.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In order to test the author-practitioner’s recipe for aquafortis, I selected the entry for applying the color of damascene steel on knives (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><span class="underline">11v</span></a>). There, the author-practitioner tells his reader to mix aquafortis with earth and rub it on the steel, and then to rub the steel with ashes or sand. He suggests that gold and silver will behave on the resulting surface as they would on a touchstone.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">For the purposes of this essay, I will only consider the materials in the recipe and not the color application process or meaning. As we have established, the fundamental property that binds together the category of aquafortis is the substance’s potency to act on lesser metals than gold. The recipe called for a demi-septier of vinegar with one ounce of verdigris, one ounce of copperas, and one ounce of <em>solle</em>, mixed together in a glass vial. Since the entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11v/f/11v/tl"><span class="underline">11v</span></a> describes a knife, I used three plates of bloomery steel.</span><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Since the author-practitioner did not specify the type of copperas, I used two vitriols in the reconstruction: blue vitriol (copper(II) sulphate) and green vitriol (iron(II) sulfate).

<p><span dir="ltr">A great number of earths and sands are mentioned in the manuscript.

The term “earth” thus often refers to clayey substances in Ms. Fr. 640. This is corroborated through other contemporary sources such as Cipriano Piccolpasso’s <em>Three books on the art of pottery</em> (1548), and Cellini’s treatises, which make use of the word <em>terra</em> in Italian (or <em>terre</em> in French) to denote clay.</span><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It was necessary to select the correct type of earth, based on its reaction with the aquafortis in the recipe.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Much like in the recipe in the <em>Summa perfectionis</em> for testing gold, the earth was likely used as a binder to make the aquafortis into a paste that could then be rubbed onto the steel.</span><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">For my reconstruction, I selected low-fire pottery clay, which I flattened and dried for a week, and then pounded it into fine powder. I put two tablespoons of the clay powder in a bowl and found that seven tablespoons of copper(II) sulfate aquafortis were adequate to saturate the powder with enough liquid to keep it from falling apart.</span><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">I mixed the substances together to make a malleable paste, which I then applied to the surface of the bloomery steel plate and rubbed into the surface with my fingers for 5 to 7 minutes. The steel reacted almost immediately; it noticeably turned red underneath the paste (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>). Next, I rubbed the paste off the bloomery steel plate using sand—I chose commercial play sand based on its abrasive and absorbent qualities—which helped clean the surface of the steel quickly and efficiently. I then repeated the process with the aquafortis containing iron(II) sulfate, and with 50% nitric acid, the latter of which produced a noticeable amount of heat.</span><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_065_fa_18/17AueugI95UPF80PSIwjUGB0YnT3EQ6o4.jpg" alt="fig. 5"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 5: Rubbing the steel with aquafortis paste, Michael Assis, Making and Knowing Lab, 2018.

<p><span dir="ltr">All of these solutions produced an immediate and lasting reaction on the surface of the steel (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>).

<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The comparison of historical recipes reveals that there is no standard recipe for aquafortis and no standard compound to which it refers. The author-practitioner’s recipe for aquafortis does not produce nitric acid, yet it is still a corrosive, thereby reaffirming the multiplicity of meanings of the substance and its ingredients, inflected by tradition, tacit knowledge, and ad-hoc solutions. The reconstruction and historical contextualization of the recipe for aquafortis allow us to better understand the materials invoked in the recipe for aquafortis on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><span class="underline">75r</span></a>, as well as to recognize that aquafortis was a category, rather than a specific compound in the medieval and early modern period.</span></p>
