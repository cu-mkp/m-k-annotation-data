<h2 id="introduction"><span dir="ltr">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Techniques for transferring an image from one object to another can be found as intermediary steps in a wide variety of craft procedures, including metal casting, printmaking, and embroidery. Ultimately, any time an artist or craftsperson translates a sketched design into a finished product, he or she is making use of some kind of image transfer technique. Given its ubiquity as an intermediary process in artistic production, it is not surprising that many of the author-practitioner’s recipes outline image transfer techniques. Among these are recipes for “writing as well from the left as from the right” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19v/f/19v/tl"><span class="underline">19v</span></a>), “pounced design for scratching satin” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><span class="underline">42v</span></a>), and “counterproofing” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/51r/f/51r/tl"><span class="underline">51r</span></a>). Along with historical research, reconstructions of these three recipes demonstrate the principles of image transfer used in each, highlighting how each technique deals with problems common to the image transferring process, such as mirroring and destructiveness.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">As BnF Ms. Fr. 640 is one of the few known sixteenth-century sources to describe counterproofing, this essay pays particular attention to the author-practitioner’s entry on this technique. It situates this entry within its historical context and compares it with other recorded counterproofing methods from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century. It also compares counterproofing as a technique for transferring images with other methods described in the manuscript as well as a method from an entirely different historical context: Japanese woodblock printing. By considering the kinds of intermediary steps and principles these various techniques employ, this essay develops an understanding of the different ways an image is transformed when it is transferred.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>

<h2 id="counterproofing-in-context"><span dir="ltr">Counterproofing in Context</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Counterproofing is a printing technique used for many different purposes since at least the sixteenth century. It involves offsetting ink from a printed surface onto a new plate or fresh piece of paper.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In his wide-ranging study of historical intaglio printmaking, Ad Stijnman explores a variety of counterproofing techniques, all of which begin, as the author-practitioner’s technique does, with a print. One such method for transferring a design from a print to a plate involves placing a fresh print onto an uncut plate while the ink is still wet, and running it through the press. If the printed ink is already dry, the print can be soaked in water, soap water, or a diluted lye solution (depending on how old the ink on the print is), in order to reactivate the ink; after this, it can be run through the press with the new plate to offset the design onto this plate.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The design can then be etched or engraved to make a new plate for printing the image. As Stijnman writes, this was an “ideal way of replicating a plate in order to extend the print run,” or to create a new plate from an image whose original plate no longer existed.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> As counterproofing is a kind of stamping technique, in which one object is pressed against another in order to transfer an image, it necessarily transfers the image in reverse. However, when the transferred image is used to make a new plate or block for printing, the process of printing reverses the image yet again. Therefore, the final image printed from the new plate is oriented in the same direction as the image from which the counterproof was initially pulled (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/1SN_JcD5Hgjoystj-Um88zt8sO8ROzRSs.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SN_JcD5Hgjoystj-Um88zt8sO8ROzRSs/view?usp=drivesdk"><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></a>: Diagram of the process of counterproofing an image onto a plate, etching or engraving the plate, and then printing the plate, Nicolle Bertozzi, 2018. © The Making and Knowing Project (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><span class="underline">CC BY-NC-SA</span></a>)</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">In addition to the manuscript, one of the other few sixteenth-century authors to document a counterproofing technique is Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574). Vasari describes using counterproofs to make the multiple blocks for his <em>chiaroscuro</em> woodblock prints (for an example of a <em>chiaroscuro</em> print, see <span class="underline"><i>fig. 2</i>)</span>. His process begins with a carved block featuring all the lines of the print and a second block featuring “all that is tinted near to the shadow.”</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The third block, which features all of the light and ground in the composition is made in the following manner:</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/1fGWuZdpaai1IG4Yobyu1CdMqEuQdqv_2.jpg" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fGWuZdpaai1IG4Yobyu1CdMqEuQdqv_2/view?usp=drivesdk"><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></a>: Hendrick Goltzius, <em>Proserpina</em>, 1594.

<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">A sheet printed by the first block […] is taken wet and placed on the plank of the pear tree and weighted down with other sheets which are not damp and so pressed upon that the wet sheet leaves on the board the impression of all the outlines […] Then the painter takes white lead mixed with gum and puts in the lights on the pear-wood. After this is done the engraver cuts them all out with tools, according as they are marked. This block is that which […] is used for the first process, namely, to produce the lights and the ground, the whole surface, therefore, is left tinted except just where it is hollowed out, because there the paper remains white.</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Like the examples described above, Vasari’s counterproofing technique involves transferring a printed image onto a block or plate for printing. Vasari uses woodblocks for relief printing, but the image transfer principle is exactly the same for plates for intaglio printing. His technique differs, however, in the way it utilizes the counterproofed image. Unlike the methods described above, Vasari does not use the counterproof technique to reproduce the exact same image onto a new block. Rather, the image he transfers serves as a reference for him to create a different but interrelated block. By painting onto the image with white lead, Vasari marks the parts of the print he wants to remain white. These parts alone are then carved away, and the rest of the block is tinted. This block then serves to print the background on top of which the other two blocks print the shadows and the lines of the image. Like the techniques above, this kind of counterproof takes advantage of the double mirroring in order to print a final image that is oriented in the same direction as the print on which it was based. But here, the counterproofed image serves more as a helpful guide for lining up a series of interrelated but incomplete blocks so that they harmonize together to form a final composite image.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">From the sixteenth century onward, there are other examples of counterproof techniques that more closely resemble the kind we see in the manuscript, namely, counterproofing an image from paper to paper. This kind of counterproof results in a completed print of an image rather than a new plate. Unlike the method used for creating a new plate or block, a counterproof that is printed on a piece of paper result in a final printed piece that is the mirror image of its original (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>, and <i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>). In many cases, the reversal of the image apparently was not a concern. For example, half of naturalist and printmaker Maria Sibylla Merian’s (1647–1717) Surinam books feature original engraved prints whereas the other half feature those same images in mirrored counterproofs. Though the reason why the books were made this way is unknown, Stijnman speculates that because the creatures depicted in Merian’s illustrations are quite symmetrical, and because counterproofing was a fast and cost-effective way of doubling the number of prints, neither Merian nor the publishers were concerned about the orientation of the illustrations.</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/1UQFvtTfu7gYVueo4xlTmpj83RtMBJ6qK.jpg" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><br>

<p><span dir="ltr">The counterproofed image differs from a typical print pulled from a block or plate in a few important ways. The image that results when a counterproof is pulled directly onto a fresh sheet of paper does not feature the three-dimensional embossing effect that is created when a print is taken from a plate or block.</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Additionally, depending on the depth of the grooves in the original intaglio plate and the amount of ink that was therefore transferred onto the original print, the quality of line differs between a print and its counterproof. Stijnman shows an original Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–1669) print of <em>The Three Crosses</em> side by side with its counterproof, which documents the relative softness of the counterproof’s lines.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In fact, some artists appear to have actively played with this particular characteristic of counterproof images. The highly experimental artist Hercules Segers (1589–1638) was perhaps the first to see his counterproofs as pieces of art rather than stored records of a given print. Like his other prints, Segers’s known counterproofs feature overpainting and other kinds of experimental manipulations, which, as Seigneur argues, shows that he considered his counterproofs on par with his other prints.</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841–1919), too, seems to have used the counterproof technique for its unique aesthetic effect. In particular, he is known for his counterproof pastel images, the lighter, airier lines of which “reinforce the delicate, sensual, and pleasurable touch of the artist’s hand.”</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Like the method described in Ms. Fr. 640, the counterproofing techniques used by Merian, Segers, and Renoir involve transferring a printed image from paper to paper.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Whereas these techniques take the mirror image print as the finished product, the author-practitioner’s method includes a further set of techniques that results in a finished product with the same orientation as the original image, and which is traced rather than directly printed or stamped.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">While the author-practitioner leaves room for the reader to end the process after the initial counterproof, he also provides instructions for turning the paper transparent using oil (either turpentine or spike lavender) and then tracing the lines on the opposite side of the paper, rendering the image the right way around once again (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>). By heating the oil-soaked paper, the author-practitioner claims that traces of the oil will disappear and the finished image will have the same orientation as the original. My attempt to pull a counterproof from a dried print using soap water served only as a proof of concept and was not successful enough to use for the remaining steps the author-practitioner outlines (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>). However, by pulling a counterproof from a fresh print and by then soaking in oil and retracing the image on the reverse side of the paper, my reconstruction clearly demonstrated the multiple image mirrorings resulting from a final image that is oriented the same way as the original (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>) (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 9)</span></i>.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/1ZZyKmxeKkYkgO6fqCyaJHx9V-7M1I17v.jpg" alt="fig. 6"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZZyKmxeKkYkgO6fqCyaJHx9V-7M1I17v/view?usp=drivesdk"><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></a>: Diagram of the process of counterproofing according to the author-practitioner’s instructions, Nicolle Bertozzi, 2018. © The Making and Knowing Project (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><span class="underline">CC BY-NC-SA</span></a>)</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/13n8clqWsPC5cBnW8tYAfk_PrjSUeB37T.jpg" alt="fig. 7"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13n8clqWsPC5cBnW8tYAfk_PrjSUeB37T/view?usp=drivesdk"><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></a>: The soap water counterproof reconstruction, Nicolle Bertozzi, 2018.

<p><span dir="ltr">Unlike Merian, who appeared unconcerned with the direction of her nature illustrations, the author-practitioner seems to care about reproducing the image not as a mirror-image, but as it was originally printed. He takes counterproof images that other artists would consider finished products and turns them into yet another intermediary step in his process. The question, then, is why is he concerned with the orientation of the image? Given the wide range of ideas about the nature of an image and its mirror image in early modern Europe, gaining a sense of why the author-practitioner includes information about how to translate the counterproof back into a non-mirrored image might shed further light on his understanding of intermediary and copied images.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In the absence of a written explanation, it is difficult to know why exactly the author-practitioner was concerned with the orientation of the final counterproofed image, however, one text that offers a clue is <em>Der zu vielen Wissenschafften dienstlich-anweisende Curiöse Künstler</em> (“The curious artist serving and instructing in many sciences”), a technical manual of craft techniques written by Adam Friedrich Kirsch published in Nuremberg in 1703. In an entry for counterproofing directly onto another piece of paper, Kirsch suggests that the technique is inappropriate for prints that feature text, since “the writing is reversed and can only be read in a mirror.” For “mere copper engravings,” however, the technique works fine.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This is, of course, true: images can be “read” and understood whether they are in their original or their mirror, particularly, as Stijnman suggests, when they are images of symmetrical things, such as animals and humans. This is true even when left and right have particular associations coded into them, such as an individual’s handedness. Rembrandt in particular was known for his prints depicting Jesus raising his left hand rather than his right. But this was evidently overlooked by consumers at the time.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Writing, on the other hand, loses meaning in its reversal. Thus, although we cannot know for certain, it is plausible that the author-practitioner imagined his readers counterproofing images that included text. This relationship between writing and mirror images is also relevant to how we understand the author-practitioner’s “for writing as well from the left as from the right” recipe. Given that the recipe ends with a letter rendered in its mirror image (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 10</span></i>), it is possible that this recipe was meant to serve as an intermediary step in a longer process that would involve another mirroring, rendering the letter the right way around again. One such longer process, of course, would be printing. It is also possible that this recipe was merely intended as a kind of “trick,” in which the author-practitioner presents a difficult challenge—writing letters in their mirror image—which he solves with a simple solution: stamping.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This entry follows another entry that uses stamping to transfer an inked line from one half of a page to the other (fol. 19v, “Mathematical figures without ruler and compass”), perhaps indicating that the author-practitioner was experimenting with the ways ink could be stamped across paper.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/1jFsgr8Jyl8GG8H_iCRZgxL4SDXRov7u_.jpg" alt="fig. 10"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jFsgr8Jyl8GG8H_iCRZgxL4SDXRov7u_/view?usp=drivesdk"><span class="underline">Fig. 10</span></a>: Letters written on small pieces of historical paper stamped onto a larger piece of paper while the ink was still wet, Nicolle Bertozzi, 2018.

While the ink was still wet, these small pieces of paper were stamped onto a larger piece of paper and rubbed with a burnisher to transfer the letter as a mirror image. © The Making and Knowing Project (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><span class="underline">CC BY-NC-SA</span></a>)</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">Other interesting examples of counterproofs with regard to this discussion of writing and mirror images are Mary Cassatt’s (1844–1926) pastel counterproofs. Among these are counterproofs pulled from pastel images that the artist had already signed. These counterproofs, which again feature a soft, delicate line that seems to have been actively sought out during the nineteenth century’s impressionist movement, feature the signature in the mirror image.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Ambroise Vollard, the commissioner of these counterproofs, was apparently not concerned about the mirrored signature, though it remains unknown whether he imagined these mirror-image counterproofs of the original pastel as completed works in and of themselves or as an intermediary step in a longer process; indeed, he may have thought of them as both.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">What this perhaps demonstrates is the fact that writing can serve multiple functions. In the case of text that is meant to be read for meaning, of course, it is important that the letters and words are not mirrored. In the case of a signature, which documents the creator of the piece but does not convey any other textual meaning, a mirror image of the writing appears to serve the intended function just as well.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Although the author-practitioner’s ideas about the importance of transferring images in the same orientation as the original ultimately remains ambiguous in his counterproofing recipe, one point that he emphasizes clearly is the technique’s non-destructive quality. On fol. 51r, he even presents a clear situation (“if, by chance, you borrowed the piece”) in which not destroying the original piece for the sake of making a copy would be important. My reconstruction demonstrated that his claims are at least plausible. While my attempts to reactivate the oil-based ink using soap water were only successful at demonstrating a proof of concept, the prints I attempted to counterproof using the author-practitioner’s recipe remain remarkably unaltered, minus some bunched paper fibers that came about only after a long series of soap-water soaks and perhaps overly vigorous rubbing with a sponge (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></i>). They did yellow slightly, which the author-practitioner warns will happen unless gummed soap water is used, but my reconstruction caused very little yellowing. Additionally, the counterproof I made with a fresh print did not alter the original in any visible way, even as it took up much more of the ink than my soap water attempts. In contrast to this technique that preserved the original, other recipes in the manuscript describe another image transfer method—pouncing—that is much more destructive in nature.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/1md3_qoSV5EEbAXRV_ko-SEVjOB_ycIsK.jpg" alt="fig. 11"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1md3_qoSV5EEbAXRV_ko-SEVjOB_ycIsK/view?usp=drivesdk"><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></a>: Etched print after being rubbed and soaked in soap water, Nicolle Bertozzi, 2018.

<p><span dir="ltr">Pouncing is a technique that involves poking holes along the lines of an image on a piece of paper. This paper is then placed on top of another object, and charcoal or other fine powder (such as flour or chalk, as described in the manuscript) is pressed through these holes (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 12</span></i>). Cennino Cennini’s (c. 1360–c. 1440) <em>Libro dell’Arte</em> contains perhaps the first known description of this technique, which was used frequently by fresco painters in Renaissance Italy, but the technique appears to have been known since at least the tenth century in China, and it has been used throughout the world as an image transfer technique in a wide variety of crafts.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Stijnman documents how pouncing was used by early modern intaglio printmakers to transfer a design onto a plate for etching or engraving.</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/1BLx-75h7hsN7B2AgRhu6rXvhriYib9Lw.jpg" alt="fig. 12"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BLx-75h7hsN7B2AgRhu6rXvhriYib9Lw/view?usp=drivesdk"><span class="underline">Fig. 12</span></a>: Diagram of the steps in pouncing as an image transfer technique, Nicolle Bertozzi, 2018. © The Making and Knowing Project (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><span class="underline">CC BY-NC-SA</span></a>)</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">The various uses of pouncing can be seen in Ms. Fr. 640 as well. The term can refer to the act of spreading out fine powder over an entire surface area, as can be seen in “Casting in frames.”</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">More often, it refers to the particular kind of pouncing using a pierced template as described above—not only in the recipe for “Pounced design for scratching satin,” but also in “For stampings to embellish and encrust or cover the edges of mirrors, the tops of chests, or the friezes of bed valances” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/6v/f/6v/tl"><span class="underline">6v</span></a>),</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">“Damasked cloth” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15r/f/15r/tl"><span class="underline">15r</span></a>),</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">and “Gilding molding for panels with <em>or mat</em>” (fol.<a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66r/f/66r/tl"><span class="underline">66r</span></a>–v). Additionally, the recipe for tracing a history on glass uses pouncing as a metaphor to describe a related technique. In this recipe, the reader is instructed to poke the pin through the paper directly onto the gilt glass, thereby marking the gilt surface directly rather than indirectly by applying a powder through the pricked paper onto the glass. Stijnman notes that this kind of “pouncing” was also used in etching, whereby the craftsperson would push the needle directly onto a plate covered in etching ground in order to transfer the design.</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It was beyond the scope of this essay to pounce on gilded glass, which is done using soot black or lampblack in “Gilding molding panels” and directly onto the surface in “Tracing some history on glass” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/39v/f/39v/tl"><span class="underline">39v</span></a>–40r),</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">nor did I attempt it on iron or copper, which is done in “For stampings to embellish and encrust or cover the edges of mirrors, the tops of chests, or the friezes of bed valances.” However, my reconstruction of the scratched satin recipe—which appears to be a recipe for pinking satin with an egg white and fig milk-based reinforcement—did suggest that pouncing works better on certain materials than it does on others.</span><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In my reconstruction, I tested my pouncing paper first on another sheet of paper to make sure the charcoal was being pressed through the holes (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 13</span></i>). Although the paper did not capture as much of the detail as I had hoped, I decided after a few tests to move on to the satin fabric. I found that the satin fabric captured much more of the detail than the paper had, making for a much clearer pounced image (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 14</span></i>). This is likely due to the differences between fabric and paper and the way they interact with fine powder. Whereas the charcoal seemed to sit atop the paper and smudged quite easily or was blown away when the paper was moved, the threads of the satin fabric “caught” the charcoal powder and held it more firmly in place. It is easy to imagine that wet stucco, as used by fresco painters, would also hold the charcoal powder. This may be one reason why pouncing is employed twice in the manuscript for fabric and never for paper.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/1oZPu2VZXgep1K6Mn9wxg1sa43u3hWfEW.jpg" alt="fig. 13"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oZPu2VZXgep1K6Mn9wxg1sa43u3hWfEW/view?usp=drivesdk"><span class="underline">Fig. 13</span></a>: Charcoal pounced onto a piece of paper, Nicolle Bertozzi, 2018.

<p><span dir="ltr">The relative destructiveness of pouncing when compared with counterproofing speaks to a different understanding of the “original” image and the value it is given in the two techniques. In addition to poking holes through the original image, pouncing with charcoal or other black powder completely obscures the lines of the original when applied from the top (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 15</span></i>). Indeed, the destructiveness of the pouncing technique was recognized in the sixteenth century, for example by the Bruges goldsmiths who sued an artist for destroying an old banner by using it as a template to pounce the pattern onto a new one.</span><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">However, it is important to note that the paper used for pouncing is not entirely destroyed, but can continue to be used as a pouncing template multiple times. Unlike the image that is counterproofed, this initial image no longer has value in and of itself; its value is instead dependent on its ability to recreate the same image on a different surface.</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/1oF63Gh-Sgih9OcV-qPPgid7CfGpvIidH.jpg" alt="fig. 15"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oF63Gh-Sgih9OcV-qPPgid7CfGpvIidH/view?usp=drivesdk"><span class="underline">Fig. 15</span></a>: Pouncing stencil after being rubbed with charcoal, Nicolle Bertozzi, 2018.

<p><span dir="ltr">In considering the level of destructiveness in the image transfer process, it is perhaps useful to consider a third technique, one in which the original image is entirely destroyed in order to transfer it onto something else. The technique I will discuss here is the one used in Japanese woodblock printing. Although this method is part of an entirely different historical context from that of the author-practitioner, it complements the comparison of counterproofing and pouncing by demonstrating how techniques used to transfer images are bound up in the kinds of value assigned to the original image.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="a-completely-destructive-technique-image-transfer-in-japanese-woodblock-printing"><span dir="ltr">A Completely Destructive Technique: Image Transfer in Japanese Woodblock Printing</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Examples of woodblock-printed material can be found in Japan as early as the eighth century CE. These early examples were largely Buddhist texts that had been brought to Japan from China.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">While movable type was introduced to Japan after it was developed in China in the eleventh century, Japanese printers found that woodblocks were a much more suitable technology for their written language (which is often written in highly cursive script that includes phonetic Japanese readings of the Chinese characters, glossed in small writing to the right of the characters), and so this technique remained dominant through the Tokugawa period (1600–1868). It was during this period that Japanese painters and woodblock carvers developed the elaborate, multi-colored woodblock prints that are today known as <em>ukiyo-e</em> (literally “images of the floating world”).</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In the first step of the woodblock-making process, an artist would create a sketch or preparatory picture, called <em>shita-e</em>, of the image to be printed. Depending on the completeness of this sketch, a copyist would create a more complete version of the drawing, called <em>hanshita-e</em>, which was then sent off to a woodblock carver.</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Unlike either counterproofing or pouncing, the method that Japanese woodblock cutters used to transfer an image onto the block completely destroys the original image. In his book <em>Japanese Prints</em>, Ellis Tinios provides a very detailed description of the process by which block cutters transferred the design of the <em>hanshita</em> drawing onto a woodblock:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">The cutter prepared a block to receive the drawing by spreading rice paste as smoothly as possible on it, using the heel of his hand. The rice paste was left until it was surface dry. He then took a broad, slightly moistened brush and swept it once up and down the face of the treated block to activate the paste. Next, he immediately positioned one edge of the block drawing along the near edge of the block. The rest of the sheet was quickly flipped over, face down, on to the block and gently smoothed out with the fingers. Finally, he rubbed the entire back of the paper gently with a tool called the <em>baren</em> until the surface was completely smooth. The block was left to dry for at least twenty-four hours to produce a very tight bond between the paper and the surface of the wood.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Once the block and block-ready drawing had dried completely, the cutter rubbed the back of the drawing with wet fingers to remove the upper layers of paper fibres. This left the thin layer of fibres that carried the artist’s design firmly bonded to the surface of the block. He then put camellia oil on his fingers and carefully rubbed it over the back of the exposed drawing. This made the paper transparent, revealing all the fine details of the design. The block was now ready for cutting.</span><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Like the technique for counterproofing an image onto a plate or block, this method takes advantage of two image reversals (the first being when the image is pasted face down onto the block and then revealed in reverse with oil, the second being when the final block is printed onto paper) to ensure that the final printed image is oriented in the same direction as the original sketch (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 16</span></i>). Because Japanese prints so often featured writing, it is easy to imagine that it was of the utmost importance that the finished print was oriented in the same direction as the initial drawing. Just like the author-practitioner’s counterproofing technique, the Japanese method uses oil to make the paper transparent in order to reveal the image from the other side. However, instead of offsetting some ink from the original image or transforming the image into a stencil by poking small holes into it, this technique completely destroys the image, which is physically attached to the medium it is being transferred to and is then cut away. Once the block has been carved, the woodblock cutter wets any of the remaining paper in order to detach the rice paste glue and remove the paper from the block.</span><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_067_fa_18/1c87PS_peCCFBmXBEGCCG-Q9kj9HGUWlq.jpg" alt="fig. 16"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c87PS_peCCFBmXBEGCCG-Q9kj9HGUWlq/view?usp=drivesdk"><span class="underline">Fig. 16</span></a>: Diagram of the image transfer technique used in Japanese woodblock printing, Nicolle Bertozzi, 2018. © The Making and Knowing Project (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><span class="underline">CC BY-NC-SA</span></a>)</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">Like the <em>chiaroscuro</em> woodblock prints discussed earlier, each colored <em>ukiyo-e</em> print requires multiple blocks, all of which are carefully coordinated so that they come together to form a complete image. Like Vasari’s technique, Japanese woodblock cutters would take <em>kyogo</em>, or prints taken from the key block that featured all of the black lines of the image, and transfer these to new blocks to serve as a reference, ensuring that the color blocks were in register with the key block when they were successively printed to form the final image. Unlike Vasari’s technique, however, these prints were not transferred to the block using counterproofing, but were instead pasted onto the block face down and treated just as the initial <em>hanshita-e</em>.</span><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In Japanese woodblock printing, the <em>hanshita-e</em> is intended as a preparatory sketch, not a finished product. Therefore, its value is tied to its ability to create a woodblock, which in turn is valuable for its ability to create a finished print. The same is true of the original images that are transformed into stencils for pouncing. Because it does not compromise the original image, however, counterproofing suggests the potential for a different relationship between the original image and its transferred version, and we see this potential reflected in the ways the counterproofing technique was used. While some original images used for counterproofs were intended to be used for their image transfer capabilities and do not have value as images in and of themselves, in other instances, the original image retained its value as a complete and finished image, and the counterproof was used to create a new plate to extend a printing run or to double the number of images created in an economical fashion.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">A comparison of these three techniques for transferring an image demonstrates the inherent relationship between the technique and the values associated with the original and transferred images. The author-practitioner’s counterproofing recipe focuses on the technique’s non-destructiveness in order to emphasize that it can be used even when replicating an image borrowed from someone else. Unlike the pouncing technique or the technique of pasting the image onto a woodblock, the original image remains valuable as a complete and final piece in and of itself. In the semi-destructive pouncing technique, the original image is altered with pricks and charcoal powder and is therefore only valuable insofar as it can function as a stencil, but does still physically exist. In the entirely destructive Japanese woodblock image transfer method, the original image is completely destroyed in the process of creating a woodblock, which in turn serves as the stencil from which finished printed images are created. Unlike the image from which a counterproof is taken, the images that are transferred in pouncing and woodblock-cutting are designed specifically to be used in this way; they are not valuable as images in and of themselves, but rather as images that create valuable images: their value lies in their ability to create a block, plate, or stencil from which a finished image can be created.</span><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">This essay has also demonstrated the way in which certain images retain the same meaning even as they are mirrored in the image transfer process whereas others—most notably text—lose meaning when transferred in reverse. Different techniques address this issue of mirroring images in different ways. Where counterproofing an image onto a plate or block and the Japanese technique for woodblock printing make use of two image reversals in order to render a final image that is oriented in the same direction as the original, counterproofing directly from paper to paper renders the final image in reverse. Although Kirsch’s seventeenth-century manual suggests that this makes the paper-to-paper counterproof method inappropriate for images with text, the author-practitioner’s method employs a second image reversal by revealing the counterproofed image on the other side of the paper to render the final image in the same orientation as the original.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> Images can be transferred from one surface to another in a variety of ways, but each image transfer technique involves transforming the image in the process. This essay has been concerned with two kinds of transformation: mirroring and destructiveness. My exploration of image transfer techniques from the manuscript and image transfer in Japanese woodblock printing has demonstrated that a relationship exists between the value of the original image—whether or not it can be destroyed in the process of its transfer and whether or not it retains meaning in its mirror image—and the techniques that are used to transfer it onto another surface. In this way, this essay suggests that developing a robust understanding of the process by which an object is made—the kind of transformations it undergoes in the intermediary steps and the ways in which materials are manipulated or even destroyed—can offer a great deal of insight into the kinds of value that are assigned to each part of the making process.</span></p>

<li id="fn29" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">Additionally, unlike the stamping technique used in counterproofing and making stamped ornaments, pouncing offers more flexibility in terms of the direction in which the image is transferred. Because the holes penetrate entirely through the paper, the image can be transferred in its original when the powder is applied from the side the image was originally drawn on, or it can be transferred in its reverse by flipping the paper over and applying the powder from the other side. This is not noted by the author-practitioner, however, and once the stencil has been pounced with charcoal or some other black powder, it cannot easily be used from the other side, as the excess charcoal would transfer onto the surface of whatever is being pounced onto.</span><a href="#fnref29" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn36" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr"> This is true even in a related Japanese woodblock carving technique called <em>kabusebori</em>, in which a completed print from a published book is used in place of the <em>hanshita-e</em>. Because the demand for certain books in Tokugawa Japan was so high, Japanese publishers developed a system in which they reserved one copy of the book to be destroyed via the image transfer process in case the original blocks were worn out but consumers still wanted additional books to be printed. See Peter Kornicki, <em>The Book in Japan: A Cultural History from the Beginning to the Nineteenth Century</em> (Leiden: Brill, 1998), 49–52.</span><a href="#fnref36" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
