<p>The author-practitioner engages in a defining question of Renaissance Europe: had the height of civilization already been reached in antiquity, or did humans still have the potential to innovate and to improve upon the past? Legendary ancient inventions, such as the burning mirror that Archimedes supposedly aimed from afar at the ships of his city’s enemies, set goals for modern discoverers (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_331_ie_19/undefined" alt="fig. 1"/><figcaption>Fig. 1.

Guido Pancirolli’s comparison of lost ancient things and modern discoveries was requested from him by the Duke of Savoy, Emanuele Filiberto (1528–1580). The title-page of this later edition compares the lost ancient things on the left to new-found things on the right. The “New World” was the first object on Pancirolli’s list of new discoveries.

<p>Throughout the manuscript, the author-practitioner joins this old contest with antiquity. Yet, his case sets the competition between ancients and moderns in a new light. We often think about the debate between the ancients and moderns as a wide-ranging but primarily scholarly debate. The author-practitioner shows that this dynamic could also be found in a more craft-oriented world.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, the author-practitioner leans on the power of ancient knowledge in justifying the publication of his book. In notes that he gathered for his planned publication, which he may have intended to call <em>The Workshop</em> (La Boutique), he began by recording a snippet drawn from an ancient source that would seem to champion the ability of the ancients over the moderns. “It can be gathered from the words of Herodotus that the navigation of the Portuguese was not newly invented by them as they brag” (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><span class="underline">162r</span></a>).</p>
<p>The author-practitioner anticipated that his book would be criticized for offering no new knowledge. He turned to the ancients for his defense. On fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><span class="underline">166r</span></a>, adapting a classical quotation from Terence, that “nothing has been said that has not been said or done before,” he suggested that it was in any case impossible to do anything new. Although he was not “able to invent anything new” he could “rediscover anew the books of Numa, buried &amp; long unknown &amp; forgotten, in order to publish them for those who do not know them” (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_331_ie_19/undefined" alt="fig. 2"/><figcaption>Fig. 2.

<p>According to Pliny, the legendary second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius, had preserved his wisdom for future generations by smearing his books with cedar oil and burying them before his death in order to be discovered again. In the late sixteenth century, the books of Numa featured among the <em>deperdita</em> or lost ancient things as both a collection of all the most desirable forms of ancient knowledge as well as a symbol of the entire idea that ancient knowledge was just waiting to be recovered.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Numa’s books encapsulated the idea that rediscovery of old things was just as wonderful and valuable as the discovery of the new.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the author-practitioner presents particular techniques as the recovery of lost ancient knowledge. For example, a technique for concave mirrors would allow for constructing the legendary burning mirrors of Archimedes (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/5v/f/5v/tl"><span class="underline">5v</span></a>). Some believed that the white crust that formed on carnelian “is a secret of ancient lapidaries that is lost” (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/13r/f/13r/tl"><span class="underline">13r</span></a>). Glassmakers “do not have the invention for making a perfect red in a work which one needs to reheat” (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><span class="underline">32v</span></a>). Making red glass out of colloidal gold suspended in solution was indeed a difficult, multi-step process known to few (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>). The author-practitioner did not explicitly refer to this as a lost ancient work, although when the process became widespread in the late seventeenth century, it was considered a lost ancient invention found again.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_331_ie_19/undefined" alt="fig. 3"/><figcaption>Fig. 3.

<p>From these examples, it would seem that the author-practitioner envisioned his practice as participating in a recovery of ancient, lost knowledge. However, there are other points when the author-practitioner does not connect objects widely considered to be lost to this movement for the recovery of lost knowledge. For example, the author-practitioner treats asbestos as an excellent item to powder and add to sand for casting (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/149r/f/149r/tl"><span class="underline">149r</span></a>). Among the learned, asbestos and asbestine (cloth made of asbestos) were renowned as lost ancient substances. As Guido Pancirolli wrote in his <em>Two Books of Memorable Things Lost and Things Found,</em> asbestos was “nowhere to be had now.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet, Pancirolli was wrong about this. Neither asbestos nor asbestine was in fact lost; the commentator on Pancirolli’s book pointed out examples of both that could be seen in princely cabinets of curiosity and as an item regularly produced on Mediterranean islands.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Visitors to cabinets of curiosity tested the wonderful properties of asbestos cloth by throwing it onto the fire and witnessing it emerging cleaner and whiter than ever (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_331_ie_19/undefined" alt="fig. 4"/><figcaption>Fig. 4.

<p>Giambattista della Porta (1535–1615) pointed out in the mid-sixteenth century that asbestos was “spun by every woman almost, if she be not ignorant of it.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The reputation of asbestos as lost among scholars at the same time that it was in fact widely available, points to the extent to which scholars were not well acquainted with craft materials. At times they carried on debates over the loss of ancient materials while remaining ignorant about the current availability of those same objects. The author-practitioner suffered no such misconceptions. When it came to available materials such as asbestos, he did not even mention the debate about whether asbestos was lost or not.</p>
<p>Electrum was another material that the author-practitioner discusses as a modern, rather than as a lost material. He describes a certain “base gold” found naturally in German as electrum on fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/149r/f/149r/tl"><span class="underline">149r</span></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One calls it gold from the Rhine, which one finds in the rivers, and is spangle gold. Goldsmiths from Germany wanted to refine it, thinking to separate it from this whiteness, which they deemed to be silver. But it always remains whiteish, which demonstrates that this whiteness is fixed, &amp; it does not lack color. This is electrum, from which one can make cups which will demonstrate poison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>Although the author-practitioner does not refer to the ancients, his description of electrum harkens all the way back to how Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) described electrum in his <em>Natural History</em>. To Pliny, electrum was either an artificial amalgam of gold and silver, or a naturally occurring metal that, made into cups, could reveal the presence of poison by forming an iridescent rainbow and emitting a crackling noise. Over a thousand years, writers repeated Pliny’s description of electrum’s powers.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>For many, rediscovery of the ancient form of electrum promised great powers. According to a work attributed to Paracelsus (1493–1541), alchemists of his time had lost the true, ancient meaning of the term <em>electrum</em>. Ancient electrum, according to him, was neither gold nor silver, nor any other naturally occurring metal, but rather the name for any metal made by art that differs from the metal from which it came (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_331_ie_19/undefined" alt="fig. 5"/><figcaption>Fig. 5. 3-Shekel coin, Carthage, 260 BCE.

<blockquote>
<p>The ancients called Electrum by its proper name; the moderns falsely call it silver. The ancients were not losers, because they knew the Electrum itself; the moderns, because they have no knowledge of Electrum, throw away their faculties, labour, and time.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>The ancients possessed a technique for compounding an electrum in particular proportions of different metals so that the resulting substance had wonderful properties, such as the ability to reveal the presence of this poison. For this reason, “our ancestors used to have their drinking-cups, dishes, and other utensils” made of electrum. Many small ancient objects made of electrum were buried and later dug up, but few understood what they were. This, complained Paracelsus, was “a mark of the ignorance of our age that it cares nothing for such objects as these.”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Electrum became one of the famous lost things of antiquity.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Blaise de Vigenère (1523–1596) connected electrum to the artificial production of ruby glass using gold, the lost technique that the author-practitioner also discussed. This preparation of gold, he said, was the “true electrum of the ancients,” and it could also be used to make cups and vessels that would reveal the presence of poison.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the author-practitioner’s description of electrum seems to share so much with these accounts of the “true electrum of the ancients,” to him, it seemed a piece of knowledge drawn not from ancient sources, but from contemporary German craftsmen.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> He describes electrum in the midst of several reports concerning German craft techniques. Although electrum has wonderful properties of revealing poison, his account suggests that it was widely available in contemporary Germany and had no need to be recovered from the past. The account of electrum as a naturally occurring silvery gold that could reveal the presence of poison had been circulating around Europe for so long that it appears to have become a piece of common knowledge, disconnected from discussions of the ancient world.</p>
<p>Like other craftspeople, the author-practitioner was not entirely cut off from ancient learning. The idea of rediscovering ancient, lost techniques occurs repeatedly throughout his manuscript. Ancient beliefs about materials such as electrum had also spread so widely over centuries that they became incorporated into common lore, sometimes even disconnected from their “ancient” identity.</p>
<p>In addition to his immersion in this craft knowledge about antiquity, the author-practitioner actively reached out to more text-based notions of the Renaissance. For the preface to his planned publication, he tried to present his collection of techniques as a recovery of ancient knowledge in ways that would appeal to a more learned audience. Yet, his engagement with this learned version of the Renaissance, as a response to anticipated criticism, could also seem fairly superficial and instrumental. The disconnection between how the author-practitioner and more learned authors treated some materials considered “lost,” such as asbestos and electrum, reveals fissures between the ways scholars and craftspeople engaged antiquity.</p>
