<p><span dir="ltr">Of the over forty medicinal entries in BnF. Ms. Fr. 640, “Medicine of the orientals against all maladies” is alone in its advice to take in the smoke of a dried herb as a treatment. This recipe on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><span class="underline">77r</span></a> is also the only reference to “oriental medicine” in the manuscript as well as the sole example of the use of a pipe to make smoke.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In other entries, however, the author-practitioner included numerous references to good and bad smoke, breath, and vapors in the context of bodily health and craft procedures that are discussed further in this essay. The recipes in the manuscript show a great deal of overlap between medical knowledge and knowledge of other types of practices. Tracing the possible genealogy of this specific recipe within a wider tradition of global medicinal practices, and discussing its relationship to other recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, offers insight into the author-practitioner’s conceptions of medicinal materials and practices.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This insight, in turn, illuminates interconnections between medical and non-medical processes. These interconnections show the importance of historicizing modern characterizations of artisanal and medical practice and their related knowledge systems.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>

<h2 id="the-recipe"><span dir="ltr">The Recipe</span> </h2>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr"><strong>Medicine of the orientals against all maladies</strong></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Dry rosemary in the month of May, then fill this bowl with powder of it, and put a lit charcoal on top. And, receive the smoke by a quite tightened mouth, and a part will come out by your nose. But if you want to purge the head also pinch the nose. Against colds, rheums, and other maladies (fol. 77r).</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">This recipe appears in a neatly written section, with a drawing of a pipe between the heading and the main body of the recipe [<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>] [<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>]. It begins with the command to “dry rosemary in the month of May.”</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Next, the author-practitioner instructs the reader to “fill this bowl with powder of it, and put a lit charcoal on top.” After filling the bowl of the clay pipe with the crushed rosemary and charcoal, he says to “receive the smoke by a quite tightened mouth, and a part will come out by your nose. But if you want to purge the head also pinch the nose. Against colds, rheums, and other maladies.” This recipe tells the reader to bring the smoke into the head (not inhale it into the lungs). As is discussed later in this essay, pipe-smoking practices in the sixteenth century rarely involved inhaling smoke into the lungs. Thus, it is not unusual that the author-practitioner calls for bringing the smoke in through the mouth to “purge the head.” Clearly, “smoking,” if defined as inhaling into the lungs, does not apply in this recipe.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Before further examining smoking, this essay will briefly situate the recipe within medical concepts and practices in the sixteenth century.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_048_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDeTdSNmpZQ1pjOFk.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig.1: “Medicine of the orientals against all maladies,” Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 77r, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris.

<h2 id="sixteenth-century-medicine"><span dir="ltr">Sixteenth-century medicine</span> </h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">According to historian Mary Lindemann, early modern perceptions of health and illness were shaped by humoral theories of balance as well as “ancient ideas of disease as an invasion of the body or as a form of pollution.”</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The writings of Hippocrates (ca. 450–370 BCE) and Galen of Pergamum (ca. 129–200 CE) viewed disease as arising from an environmentally influenced imbalance of the four humors (black bile, yellow or red bile, blood, and phlegm).</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Within this humoral tradition, prevention “was as important as treatment” and health was maintained through modifying the humors by employing the six non-naturals.</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Lindemann argues that until at least the seventeenth century, “a mixture of <em>environmentalism</em> and <em>humoralism</em> dominated interpretations of disease” for both lay and learned people.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While historian Michael Stolberg acknowledges the presence of concerns about balancing bodily humors in the sixteenth century, in his research with medical case histories he has found “a very pronounced tendency to localise disease processes” and imbalance in specific organs.</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">As a consequence, many early modern physicians viewed diseases or the causes of disease as “accumulations of crude or otherwise morbid, harmful matter,” or “fluxes.”</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">During this period, many physicians called a common type of flux a “catarrh,” which was attributed to “watery, mucous or corrupt matter that had accumulated in the head.”</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Since “rheume” is another term for “catarrh,” the author-practitioner is probably referring to the same type of ailment on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl"><span class="underline">77r</span></a>. The recipe’s instructions to take smoke into the head as a targeted treatment, and not breathe it into the lungs, also echoes the common sixteenth-century belief that treatments should target the specific location of the ailment.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The idea that an aromatic smoke would be a helpful treatment for colds or fluxes can first be contextualized in beliefs about infected air.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> The belief that air could be corrected or protected by good smells, especially the smells of aromatic herbs like rosemary, led to practices of fumigation for health during this period.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">As mentioned above, the ideas about humoral balance during this period resulted in “hot” treatments for “cold” ailments. Since rosemary was considered a hot and dry herb, it thus makes sense that it was used against head colds, as described on fol. 77r.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>

<h2 id="rosemary-in-ms.-fr.-640-and-as-a-medicine"><span dir="ltr">Rosemary in Ms. Fr. 640 and as a Medicine</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">In addition to its use in “Medicine of the orientals against all maladies,” as part of a treatment to purge the head of “colds, rheums, and other maladies,” rosemary appears in three other recipes in the manuscript: fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98r/f/98r/tl"><span class="underline">98r</span></a>, “Borders of a garden,” fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102v/f/102v/tl"><span class="underline">102v</span></a>, “Infusion of anthos or rosemary,” and fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/126v/f/126v/tl"><span class="underline">126v</span></a>, “Plants difficult to burn in the <em>noyau</em>.” These recipes show the author-practitioner’s knowledge about rosemary as it is grown and as it is used as <em>materia medica</em>, and in other processes. On fol. 98r, the author-practitioner describes the cultivation of rosemary, advising on how to make the holes “with an iron stake, where you will plant your rosemary. Behead &amp; cut to measure and prune from the bottom up.” Fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102v/f/102v/tl"><span class="underline">102v</span></a> provides a medicinal recipe for making an infusion of “anthos or rosemary.”</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This recipe demonstrates knowledge about the process of distilling the oil of rosemary, a common method for extracting the plant’s aromatic oils and other substances perceived to contain medicinal virtues.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In this recipe, the author-practitioner provides a timeline for each process and asserts that the purpose of the infusion is “for the elderly.” This may demonstrate the author-practitioner’s belief in rosemary’s anti-aging and memory enhancing benefits, both often mentioned in the sources of the period.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The final recipe containing rosemary on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/126v/f/126v/tl"><span class="underline">126v</span></a> deals with casting plants from life, and mentions rosemary in a marginal note as a counter example to “plants difficult to burn in the <em>noyau</em>.” In this note, the author-practitioner asserts that rosemary has lined stems and that it burns well when the plaster mold is heated.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Belief in the beneficial virtues of rosemary has a long and global history.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Rosemary appeared in the writings of Dioscorides (40–90 CE) and Galen, and by the later Middle Ages had gained a “hallowed status” in Europe.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Christian legends say that the shrub got its virtuous blue flowers from the mantle of Mary, and “the shrub does not grow higher than Christ’s height on earth, and at the age of 33 it ceases to grow and increases only in breadth.”</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In ancient Greece, rosemary was worn as a wreath upon the head for better memory during examinations and was also placed under pillows or beds to prevent nightmares.</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Sixteenth-century references to rosemary also frequently mention its use by the Romans to treat jaundice after drinking.</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The name “rosemary” comes from the Latin compound of <em>ros</em> and <em>marinus</em> (<em>rosmarinus</em>) or “sea dew,” which alludes to its native habitat along the Mediterranean coastal region.</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In his widely published 1542 <em>Historia Stirpium,</em> Leonhart Fuchs (1501–1566) references the works of Dioscorides and Galen when outlining rosemary’s properties, and he mentions the herb’s Greek name, <em>libanotis</em>, which was “called <em>rosmarinus</em> by the Romans.”</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This shows a continuity of knowledge about rosemary and its perceived medicinal virtues leading into the sixteenth century.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">By the sixteenth century, rosemary’s reputation as a sort of medical panacea was widely acknowledged in European herbals and medicinal treatises. An early English herbal, printed anonymously in 1525, calls for boiling the “hot and dry” herb and drinking it, “for it is much worth against all evils in the body.”</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Preceding this herbal, the fourteenth-century English friar Henry Daniel (c. 1315–c. 1385) wrote an entire treatise on the herb, describing the numerous medicinal virtues of rosemary and listing a variety of uses. As in the 1525 herbal, Daniel mentions the herb’s uses for a range of conditions, from gout, colds and hair loss, to nightmares, memory loss and aging skin.</span><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> The most commonly discussed virtues of rosemary relate to the brain and head. In the words of William Shakespeare (1564–1616), “there’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.”</span><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In the herbal of Rembert Dodoens (1517–1585), originally published in Flemish in 1554 and translated from French to English in 1578, the author states that “the Arrabians and their successours [sic] Physitions, do say that Rosemarie co[m]forteth the brayne, the memory and the inwarde Senses, &amp; that it restoreth speach.”</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Like Fuchs, he also cites Dioscorides and Galen when describing its virtues, when boiled, against jaundice. Further, Pietro Andrea Matthioli (1501–1577), in the 1579 French translation of his commentaries on Dioscorides, provides nearly three pages on the herb.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In Ms. Fr. 640, fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/35v/f/35v/tl"><span class="underline">35v</span></a>, the author-practitioner writes “See Mathiol” at the end of an entry about dusting meat with the bitter herb called calf’s foot root, apparently in reference to Matthioli’s work.</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Sources predating and contemporary with Ms. Fr. 640 contain medicinal recipes that involve using rosemary as a fumigant. In the Appendix to chapter CLXXX of his <em>Great Herbal</em>, Fuchs states that “the later physicians say that rosemary as a fumigant eases a cough and dripping [noses], and, what is especially noteworthy, when burned it renders the house safe during pestilence by its fumes diluting the danger of impure air.”</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Further, Friar Daniel’s manuscript states that if “þou hawe gret cold in þin hed take þe smoke of his bark in þin nase and þou shalt felyn helpe.”</span><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In his works, Nicholas Culpeper (1616–1654) echoes earlier texts in recommending rosemary for a variety of maladies but also provides examples of other materials to use as fumigants aside from rosemary (such as rue, bitumen, and crushed amber).</span><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Significantly, in <em>The English physician</em>, he also advises “to burn the Herb in Houses and Chambers” to “correcteth the Air in them” and says, “the dried Leavs shred smal and taken in a Pipe like as Tobacco is taken, helpeth those that have any Cough or Phtisick, or Consumption.”</span><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Like the recipe on fol. 77r, Culpeper’s text calls for the use of powdered rosemary in a pipe. This gives evidence that the burning of rosemary in pipes as a medical practice had appeared in both France and England by the seventeenth century.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="rosemary-in-france"><span dir="ltr">Rosemary in France</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">In his herbal, Fuchs asserts that “today [rosemary] is planted everywhere in gardens and pots. However, in Narbonne, in France, it grows so abundantly that the inhabitants burn no other wood.”</span><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Dodoens states that “rosmary groweth naturally, and plentifully, in divers places of Spayne and France, as in Prouence and Languedoc. They plante it in this countrie in gardens, and mayntayne it with great diligence.”</span><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In his notes to Friar Daniel’s text, Mäkinen quotes botanist John Gerard (1545–1613), “rosemarie there is such plentie thereof in Languedocke, that the inhabitants burne scarce any other fuell.”</span><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Clearly, rosemary grew abundantly in France during the sixteenth century, and botanical knowledge about the herb circulated in southern France in medicinal and botanical texts. According to botanical historian Agnes Arber, Montpellier university had an important “school of botany,” and “most of the principal herbals published in other languages appeared in French versions quite early in their history.”</span><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The availability of rosemary and written accounts of its characteristics were not the only reasons for its popularity as a fumigant; sixteenth-century beliefs about the relationship between smell and medicine were also important.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="smell-and-smoke-in-medicine"><span dir="ltr">Smell and Smoke in Medicine</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Smell has played a role in medical thinking since antiquity. Hippocrates, in his works <em>Airs, Waters, and Places</em> and <em>Nutriment</em>, mentions “bad smells” in the context of disease diagnosis and prevention.</span><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Until the work of Conrad Victor Schneider (1640–1680) in the later seventeenth century, physicians expressed a belief in a porous “breast- or nipple-like” plate “separating the nasal and cerebral cavities.”</span><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In <em>The Olfactory Organ</em>, Galen argued that the nose “was no more than a passage which carried smells up to the true olfactory organ, the brain itself.”</span><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Thus, with no barrier of protection, the brain could be affected by both “good” and “bad” smells. In addition to the physiognomy of sensory reception, the belief in smells as materials themselves contributed to their significance in narratives of health.</span><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In his work on smell and health, historian Richard Palmer discusses instances in which smells were part of treatment for “cold complexions of the brain, for various kinds of headache, for catarrh, for melancholy, and for nervous conditions.”</span><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The overlap of ideas about medicine, aromatics, and perfumery present in Ms. Fr. 640 thus reflects links between scent and health in the sixteenth century. According to Palmer, perfumery was “a trade which developed rapidly from the Middle Ages onwards with the development of distilling and the extraction of essential or volatile oils.”</span><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Thus the use of “aromatic fires and fumigations, scented candles, rose water, aromatic herb and sweet-smelling flowers, perfumed clothes and bedding” was widespread by the sixteenth century.</span><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The oil of rosemary was often an ingredient in perfumes and soaps in addition to spirits and liqueurs.</span><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">According to literary historian Holly Dugan, “early modern medical authorities recognized perfume as both a contagion and a cure for the plague, making and masking the presence of dangerous air.”</span><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Because it was an inexpensive aromatic herb, during periods of plague there was a rise in the use of rosemary as a preventative or curative.</span><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Not just valued for its smell, rosemary was also praised as a food item because of its status as a hot and dry herb. Historian David Gentilcore characterizes the mid-sixteenth century as a period when “Galenic writings formed the basis of elaborate theories about how foods affect the human body and what combinations of food would foster optimal health.”</span><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Humoral theories of balance thus influenced eating habits. According to Gentilcore, to balance a person or body part with a “cold” complexion or disease, physicians would often prescribe “hot” foods.</span><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In his herbal, Fuchs mentions rosemary’s cultivation as condiment herb, and the herb appears in other contemporary herbals in food-related recipes for the improvement of health.</span><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> This helps explain why rosemary is used to treat a cold ailment in the recipe on fol. 77r, albeit as a fumigant.</span></p>

<h2 id="smell-and-smoke-in-ms.-fr.-640"><span dir="ltr">Smell and Smoke in Ms. Fr. 640</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">References to smells and smoke appear throughout both medicinal and non-medicinal recipes in Ms. Fr. 640. The word “smoke” (<em>fumee</em>) is used over fifty times and is referred to as a colorant for fabrics and metals, as something to be avoided when deemed harmful, as an indicator of processes in the workshop, and as a medicinal treatment (Table 1). Other recipes mention vapors and breath in similar contexts and use indicators of scent (Table 2).</span><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Further, there are a number of instances in which the author-practitioner uses the verb, <em>parfumer</em>, to refer to fumigation and other processes involving smoke and vapors.</span><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner’s references to smoke, vapors, and breath as materials and tools in workshop practices demonstrate the importance of knowledge gained through smell, such as certain smells being bad for processes like gilding or good for medicinal smoke. Such sensory knowledge connected workshop processes that employed the body as a tool with medicinal processes that cured the body.</span></p>

<h2 id="pipes-and-smoking"><span dir="ltr">Pipes and Smoking</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The history of the use of pipes for smoking herbs provides one way to approach “Medicine of the orientals.” It is important to reiterate that in the recipe on fol. 77r, the author-practitioner instructs the reader to “receive the smoke by a quite tightened mouth” into the head, not the lungs. Pipe smoke is typically not inhaled into the lungs, thus the author-practitioner could simply be reporting common pipe usage. In some of the sources mentioned below, however, accounts of smoking from pipes do refer to inhalation into the lungs. Tobacco is the most common herb burned in early mentions of pipe use. A history of pipes in a global context, therefore, typically centers on the use and trade of tobacco.</span><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In their introduction to <em>Smoke: A Global History of Smoking,</em> Sander L. Gilman and Zhou Xun begin their history with Columbus’ encounter with Native Americans smoking dried tobacco leaves.</span><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Widely cultivated in the Americas by the sixteenth century, tobacco had also been “smoked as part of ritual practices in North and South America well before it began to be cultivated, during the period from 5,000 to 3,000 BCE.”</span><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This smoke was also used as a medicine. In his book on global medical history, Roy Porter writes that in the sixteenth century “North American Indian tribes . . . inhaled the smoke from burning twigs to treat chest conditions.”</span><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This use as a treatment for chest conditions indicates that the smoke was likely inhaled into the lungs in these cases. Thomas Harriot (1560–1621) in his 1588 text about his travels to Virginia discusses the benefits of using tobacco:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">the lea[v]es thereof being dried and brought into powder: they [u]se to take the fume or smoke thereof by sucking it through pipes made of claie into their stomacke and heade; from whence it purgeth superfluous fleame and other grosse humors, openeth all the pores and passages of the body: by which meanes the [u]se thereof, not only preser[v]eth the body from obstructions; but also if any be, so that they ha[v]e not beene of too long continuance, in short time breaketh them: wherby their bodies are notably preser[v]ed in health.</span><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">By the late sixteenth century, then, it was not unknown to use herbs in clay pipes as medicine, by taking the smoke into the head and also, in some cases, inhaling it into the lungs.</span><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The spread of tobacco led to the diffusion of clay pipes as smoking implements around the world in the sixteenth century.</span><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">According to Gilman and Xun, what surprised sixteenth-century Europeans was the use of the pipe to deliver the smoke directly into the body instead of fumigating in “rooms full of smoke.”</span><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">They assert that “pipes of white ball-clay were first manufactured by the English towards the end of the sixteenth century.”</span><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the French in Florida had been introduced to tobacco smoking with clay pipes earlier in the sixteenth century. The chronicler John Sparke reported on John Hawkin’s voyage to the West Indies in 1565, writing, “The Floridians when they travell, have a kind of herbe dried, who with a cane and an earthen cup in the end, with fire, and the dried herbs put together, doe sucke thorow the cane the smoke thereof.”</span><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> It is difficult to precisely date and trace the introduction of clay pipes into Europe, but it seems that this type of pipe was relatively new in the sixteenth century, and the author-practitioner’s inclusion of a pipe illustration may therefore have been due to his recent encounter with the implement.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="a-medicine-of-orientals"><span dir="ltr">A “Medicine of orientals”</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Another way of approaching the author-practitioner’s choice of title is to look to the possible meaning of his terminology in a sixteenth-century context. In early modern Europe, “oriental” was used to refer generally to “easterner.”</span><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The precise reason for the use of the term in the recipe on fol. 77r is difficult to ascertain from the body of the recipe. As mentioned above, rosemary was widely grown in France at the time. This reference could therefore be related to the diffusion of pipe smoking practices or ideas about eastern uses of smoke as medicine. In relation to eastern trade, tobacco smoking spread to Asia and Africa in the sixteenth century, while in India the Mughals “mixed tobacco with other more familiar leaves, spices and sandalwood” and used a water pipe or <em>hookah.</em></span><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The use of water pipes in eastern regions like Persia, India, and China would have been known to sixteenth-century Europeans via trade and travel.</span><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">During the early usage of clay pipes in Europe, there may have thus been a conflation between this sort of pipe and eastern water pipes.</span><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Further, given the non-linear networks of global exchange, it is possible that the author-practitioner came to learn about the pipe as a smoke delivery system from an eastern source.</span><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="modern-usage-and-reconstruction"><span dir="ltr">Modern Usage and Reconstruction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Rosemary continues to be both used as a dried herb and distilled into an essential oil for medicinal and culinary purposes, and it has been tested in recent years to find a relationship between its chemical properties and its health benefits.</span><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The herb has also retained its ancient association with remembrance.</span><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">According to a twenty-first-century annotated edition of Nicholas Culpeper’s herbal, rosemary’s modern usages include its use, by infusion, as “a remedy for headache due to gastric disturbance,” as an anti-flatulent, and as an ingredient in shampoo.</span><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Further, smokers of herbs still smoke crushed rosemary in pipes (often in mixes with other dried herbs) or inhale it as a fumigant by burning it in a ceramic bowl.</span><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">I decided to reconstruct the recipe in order to try out the author-practitioner’s directions and to experience the sensory elements of the recipe firsthand.</span><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">I have no experience smoking a pipe, and therefore I read advice for beginners on various websites.</span><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Most forums advise not to inhale because of the strength of the tobacco or other powdered herb. Present-day pipes are generally lit with matches and not charcoal (charcoal is still used for water pipes) so I did not find modern directions for lighting a pipe with charcoal. The author-practitioner does not indicate how much rosemary powder to use, the fineness of the powder, or how one packs the powder into the pipe. Through my reconstruction I learned that each of these factors is important in the successful ignition and delivery of pipe smoke. As a completely inexperienced pipe smoker, I was quite slow at the process of preparing the pipe so that the rosemary would light and not just get sucked through the mouthpiece as a powder. The mention that some smoke will come out your nose seems to indicate that the author-practitioner had experience either of practicing or witnessing this recipe. The author-practitioner does not mention the smell or taste of rosemary or warn against the burning experienced if the smoke is swallowed, however. This may have already been common knowledge about pipe smoking in the period or was deemed irrelevant to the recipe. It remains unclear whether the author-practitioner tried this recipe himself.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The recipe “Medicine of the orientals against all maladies” is a product of early modern medicinal practice and global exchange. The use of dried rosemary in a clay pipe, though perhaps not as common as the use of tobacco, is not surprising given the widespread availability and use of rosemary in France as an aromatic fumigant and as a medicine in other forms. The introduction of the clay pipe to Europe as a smoking implement is hard to date precisely, but it appears to have been a relatively new item in the mid to late sixteenth century. The author-practitioner’s inclusion of a careful drawing of a pipe in the recipe on fol. 77r may also indicate the novelty of the implement. The reason for the author-practitioner’s use of “oriental” remains obscure but may relate to a conflation with eastern smoke delivery systems (water pipes) or the importation of pipes from the Americas via trade routes in the east. A reconstruction of the recipe leaves uncertain whether the author-practitioner had personal experience using the aromatic smoke of rosemary in a clay pipe as a medicine or whether he learned about this practice from other sources. The inclusion of the pipe illustration shows that the author-practitioner either saw a pipe in person or had access to a drawing of one.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Finally, when discussed in relation to other medical and non-medical recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, “Medicine of the orientals against all maladies” on fol. 77r serves as a starting point for an exploration of smell and smoke in the manuscript. The overlap in language and practice suggests that more may be learned by examining the medical recipes in the manuscript in relation to the sensory processes and knowledge of workshop practices.</span></p>
