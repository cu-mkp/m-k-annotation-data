<p><span dir="ltr">BnF Ms. Fr. 640 contains many entries that describe sand-casting processes, both for making sand molds and for casting into sand molds. To make a successful mold, a dry “sand” and a wet binding agent are combined to create a mixture that is able to take and hold an impression, as well as withstand the heat and pressure of a molten material.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">A “sand” can be made from a variety of materials. The author-practitioner mentions, among many options, calcined ox hooves, pulverized sand, and burned felt, as ingredients in sand molds.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Ms. Fr. 640 also cites diverse materials that may be used as “wet” binding agents, which are often called “Magistry” or <em>magistra</em> in early modern craft recipes. In <em>Pirotechnia</em>, Biringuccio provides a recipe for making a magistry of salt and water: “Because it is necessary that the powders made for casting have a magistery of salt water, I wish now to teach you to prepare the salt that must form this magistery, for without it these powders would not have the toughness to hold themselves together when they dry.”</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Hugh Plat also uses this term in an entry in his 1594 <em>Jewel house of art and nature</em>, but not in the context of molding or casting processes.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="magistra"><em><span dir="ltr">Magistra</span></em></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">What is the meaning of “<em>magistra,</em>” and why might it be used in these binder recipes? Do these binders have special properties that would merit the term “magistry,” or does the word have multiple meanings? Moreover, what are these binders, are they all alike, or can some be called “magisterial,” and others not? By considering the materials used in Ms. Fr. 640’s mold-making recipes and by investigating the materials themselves, it is possible to understand why one binding agent might be preferable to another. For example, egg whites as a binder may give a different strength than wine and elm root decoction.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The French term <em>magistra</em> is derived from the Latin word <em>magisterium</em>, used in Classical Latin to refer to the office of a magistrate, and sometimes used later in medieval Latin to refer to the philosophers’ stone.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The term <em>magistra</em> does not appear in Randle Cotgrave’s 1611 French-English dictionary, although he defines a related word <em>magistère</em> as “Maistership, authoritie, sway, cheefe rule, also, maisterie, a maisters part, or maisterpeece.”</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This entry is followed by several related terms that may relate to the author-practitioner’s use of <em>magistra</em>: the adjective <em>magistral</em> implies skilled mastery: “Magistrall; of a maister, or magistrate, or maister; also, maister-like; artificiall, skilfull, cunning.”</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The adverb <em>magistralement</em> similarly connotes skill: “Maister-like, expertly, artificially, cunningly.”</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Turning to English usage, the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> defines “Magistry” as having chymical import, with most usage of the word in seventeenth-century texts.</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Magistry can mean a “master principle of nature, free of impurities...a substance, such as the philosopher’s stone, capable of transmuting or changing the nature of other substances,” but can also denote the “residuum obtained by an acid solution; a precipitate; a resinous extract.”</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In alchemical texts, the magistery or <em>magisterium</em> can refer to the great work, the <em>opus magnum</em>, or the attainment of the philosophers’ stone by which the corruptions of both humans and metals could be rectified and brought to a higher state of health. In <em>Archidoxis</em>, Paracelsus writes, “This therefore is a <em>Magistery</em>, viz that which can be Extracted out of things without any separation or Preparation of the Elements, and yet notwithstanding, the Powers and virtues of things, are by the addition of some thing, attracted into that matter and conserved there.”</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">While <em>magistra</em>, or magistery, possesses several meanings, in Ms. Fr. 640, it would seem to have two dimensions: first, as a masterpiece of skill, and, second, as a substance that can effect material transformation, for example, in Ms. Fr. 640, “<em>eau magistra</em>” can render a dry substance moist, or “tempered,” and a lean substance fat, or unctuous.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In a recipe for casting on fol. 68r, the author-practitioner specifies that a sand “releases very neatly, does not want to be moistened with magistra or anything else, but needs to be completely dry, in its natural state, finely pulverized.” Because both wine and “well-beaten glair of egg” (i.e., egg whites) are mentioned on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><span class="underline">84v</span></a> as substances with which to moisten sands, <em>Magistra</em> would seem in contrast to indicate a mixture. Moreover, on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69r/f/69r/tl"><span class="underline">69r</span></a>, the author-practitioner specifies wine <em>or magistra</em>, and <em>magistra or</em> egg glair. Thus, the author-practitioner differentiates here between <em>magistra</em> and binding agents that are not mixtures of two or more ingredients. Indeed, on fol. 84v, salt and water, and wine and elm root are named as <em>magistras</em>.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">On fol. 84v, elm roots boiled in wine are given as a better alternative to salt water, which “some people” think is “not good.” This mixture is also mentioned on fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69r/f/69r/tl"><span class="underline">69r</span></a>, <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/72r/f/72r/tl"><span class="underline">72r</span></a>, <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85v/f/85v/tl"><span class="underline">85v</span></a>, and <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><span class="underline">87v</span></a>. On fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/69v/f/69v/tl"><span class="underline">69v</span></a>, it forms a remedy for “lean sands;” on fol <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/72r/f/72r/tl"><span class="underline">72r</span></a>, it is used for molds in which copper will be cast; and, on 86r, where the author-practitioner recounts his experiments with sands, he gives egg glair as an alternative to the wine and elm root mixture: “Since then I molded the bone of oxen feet, burned, pulverized, &amp; sieved through a double sieve &amp; <del>hum</del> <del>fort</del> moistened with glair of egg or wine boiled with elm root.”</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="making-eau-magistra"><span dir="ltr">Making <em>eau magistra</em></span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Both “<em>Eau Magistra</em>” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><span class="underline">84v</span></a> and “<em>Magistra</em>” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/87v/f/87v/tl"><span class="underline">87v</span></a> describe how the decoction should be made: “Founders take the roots of a young elm when it is in sap, &amp; boil it in wine, or better yet vinegar, and keep it all year long in a barrel” (fol. 87v). There are several interesting points to note about this entry: first, the author-practitioner writes about founders in the third person, possibly excluding himself from this group; second, the fact that the <em>magistra</em> is made in large quantities and stored, indicating that the time of year and the rising of the sap in the tree is important; and, third, that wine and vinegar are apparently equivalent for making this decoction.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In our experiments to reconstruct different <em>magistras</em>, we were able to make a substance that performed well in sand-casting and that behaved similarly to egg white, or glair. We set out to follow the recipe, a seemingly straightforward process, as the manuscript simply instructs to boil wine with elm root. Nevertheless, we encountered various obstacles in its recreation. To begin, we chose an inexpensive Cabernet Sauvignon, given the apparent equivalence between wine and vinegar. We were unable to harvest elm root when the sap was rising, instead using slippery elm inner bark powder, which is still used in CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) recipes.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">We substituted this for the freshly harvested elm root.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The recipe did not specify the quantity of elm root, and, with a scarcity of early modern sources on this point,</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> we consulted modern medicinal recipes to determine the quantity. Boiling one cup of wine with two teaspoons of powdered slippery elm bark resulted in a viscous liquid that smelled of fruit and had the thick, mucilaginous texture of egg whites. The substance coheres, forming globules much like the mucous-like character of egg whites, but with a more uneven consistency.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>)</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_011_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDVHhoYnB1dW9rZHM.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDVHhoYnB1dW9rZHM"><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></a>: Pouring elm root and wine <em>magistra</em> into the sand.

<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="glair-of-egg"><span dir="ltr">Glair of egg</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">As discussed above, egg whites were also used as a binding agent and are mentioned in several recipes in Ms. Fr. 640;</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">however it is unclear if the author-practitioner considered egg whites to be a <em>magistra</em>, or, as his aforementioned account of sand experiments on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85v/f/85v/tl"><span class="underline">85v</span></a> implies, it was an alternative to using <em>magistra</em>.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In the entry “Glair of eggs” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/82r/f/82r/tl"><span class="underline">82r</span></a>) the author-practitioner suggests that its particular advantage as a binding agent is its strength: “Glair of eggs gives strength to sand to make several casts.” Other entries in Ms. Fr. 640 use egg glair for molding and casting: on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><span class="underline">83r</span></a>, in “Another sand,” the author-practitioner recommends mixing well-beaten egg glair with clay earth and vine charcoal, calcining the mixture, then tempering it with vinegar. In the entry for “Sand for lead, the most excellent of all, for high and low reliefs”on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><span class="underline">84v</span></a>, egg glair is used to moisten ceruse (lead white) for use in a mold. On fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/85v/f/85v/tl"><span class="underline">85v</span></a> in “Founder,” egg glair is mixed with earth in making the mold for bells. The recipe “Excellent sand for lead, tin and copper” on fol. 86v, which mentions many materials for sand molds, including burned bone, iron dross, and burned felt, uses egg glair as a binder, and reportedly enabled more than one cast in the mold.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="the-squeeze-test"><span dir="ltr">The Squeeze Test</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">We tested both egg whites and the elm root and wine decoction as binders for sand molding in frames. Our sand was made of previously-used molds (which had been made from 1:1 crushed brick and plaster of Paris).</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">While they had small differences, the sand mixture with egg glair and that with elm root decoction were very similar to one another in tactile handfeel properties. When mixed with the sand, the consistency for both mixtures was almost more oily than wet, and the sand clumped like moist brown sugar rather than a soft, wet clay. It was easy to tell when the consistency of the sand made it ready for the molds: we used a “squeeze test” described in “Casting in frames” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><span class="underline">118v</span></a>: the sand should give “a good hold, nevertheless coming apart easily” (<em>faisoict bonne prise sesmiant touteffois aisement)</em>. The importance of this expression, which is used several times in the manuscript, about how to determine the correct liquid content and consistency of molding sand became clear to us as we worked. In order to make this test, we took a handful of the sand mixture and squeezed it into the palm. If it held together, but could also be easily broken apart by applying pressure to it with a fingertip, it was ready for molding. (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>) This was in contrast to another sand we made using ammonium chloride and brandy as a binder, in which the sand turned out muddy and wet, very different from when we used egg glair or the elm root-wine decoction. (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>) The two sands made with egg glair and elm root-wine decoction packed exceptionally well into the frame molds. They did not seem too moist or too dry, and both produced detailed impressions.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>) Just as the recipes in the manuscript indicate, the mold made with egg white was strong enough to endure two castings of molten tin (and could very possibly have cast a third).</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>) The mold made with the elm root <em>eau magistra</em> produced a fine product, but the mold did not hold up well enough to produce two castings.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>)</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_011_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDM3NkZV9pTXhlSUk.png" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDM3NkZV9pTXhlSUk"><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></a>: “Squeeze test” of <em>eau magistra</em> (elm root and wine mixture).

<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">In conclusion, our research shows the author-practitioner’s interest in experimenting with different types of binders, including <em>magistra</em>. All these binders, whether labelled as <em>magistra</em> or not, played a crucial role in transforming substances from one state to another in order to produce new properties: in this case, to create a sand of just the right consistency that would withstand the casting of molten metal. Our experiments with egg glair replicated the statements in Ms. Fr. 640 about the strength of this binding agent and its ability to withstand multiple castings. The <em>magistra</em> made with elm root and wine also performed well, and might have had the added benefit of being able to be made in large quantities and stored for long periods of time.</span></p>

<li id="fn16" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr"> Other evidence in the manuscript and Biringuccio’s discussion of <em>magistra</em> suggest that <em>magistra</em> differs from other binders in its inclusion of material perceived as salts. In Biringuccio and other metalworkers’ material imaginary, salt seemed to provide “fat,” or unctuosity, to the lean sand. Like the healthy human body, a good mold must also be in balance; in the case of the mold, the balance is between fat and lean. The mix of these qualities provided for a mold that took an impression well, and was very robust, not too brittle on being heated and in pouring the metal, but still friable enough to release the metal after casting. A good mold could also be tempered appropriately to balance the fatness or leanness of the metal going into it.</span><a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
