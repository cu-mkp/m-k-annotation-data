<h4 id="katie-bergen"><span dir="ltr">Katie Bergen</span></h4>
<h2 id="introduction"><span dir="ltr">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">In his agricultural treatise, <em>La maison rustique</em>, Charles Estienne (1504–1564) describes how to breed puppies that will grow up to become good hunting dogs.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This entry forms its own chapter within the book on hunting and wildlife and consists of multiple paragraphs of description of dog breeds, care, feeding, sickness, and breeding.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Estienne discusses different breeds of dogs by noting the color of their fur and describing which types of dogs have certain characteristics: some are afraid of cold water, some will not run in the heat, some are more vigorous, and some are easier to train.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">He continues this thought by giving detailed descriptions of what to look for in a good hunting dog across breeds: upright posture, a big head with large, open nostrils, big ears, large haunches, and a muscular neck.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Ms. Fr. 640 also contains entries to do with dogs. On fol. &lt;131r&gt;, the author-practitioner describes how to teach a dog well: “it is necessary to keep it tied up &amp; when it does what you command it, to make it love you, give it some cheese that has been held under your armpit.”</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Later, he goes on to describe small dogs (shaggy ones ought to have a larger muzzle than others), and, under a heading which simply reads “dogs,” he describes a process by which one can avoid being bitten by a pack of raving hounds by always carrying small balls of pitch. If you throw these at the dogs they will bite down on them, sticking their jaws together such that they are unable to bite.</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> These entries present fundamentally different approaches to recording information about the natural world. While the two texts share dogs as a topic of interest, the information each author deems worthy of recording about that topic has a markedly different character.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Such similarities and differences have inspired the following essay comparing and contrasting Ms. Fr. 640 with <em>La maison rustique</em>, in order to investigate whether or not the manuscript has significant relationships to genres outside the book of secrets. The sixteenth century saw the development of print culture, as well as economic pressures on food supply. Both these factors contributed to a new readerly appetite for domestic instruction books like <em>La maison rustique</em>, also known as household manuals.</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> A significant proportion of recipes the author-practitioner has included in his manuscript are about cultivation. Out of the roughly thousand entries, fifty-two of them mention cultivation in some way—in other words, just over five percent—and this inclusion merits investigation.</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> The Making and Knowing Project website locates the manuscript between the genres of the book of secrets and recipe books more broadly. Nevertheless, the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 chose to include a variety of recipes whose subjects overlap with the contents of household manuals such as <em>La maison rustique</em>. It is therefore instructive to look more closely at the ways in which the concerns of both books overlap and diverge.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The author of <em>La maison rustique</em>, Charles Estienne, was born in 1504 into a well-to-do printing family in Paris.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Estienne studied anatomy and became a well-regarded intellectual and humanist. He published an anatomical treatise <em>De dissectione</em> in 1548, and a humanist encyclopedia that gathered together terms and names from antiquity, <em>Dictionarium historicvm ac poeticum: omnia gentium, hominum, locorum, fluminum, ac montium antiqua recentioráq; ad sacras ac prophanas historias, poetarúmque fabulas intelligendas necessaria vocabula, bono ordine complectens</em>, in 1553. The agricultural compendium that would become <em>La maison rustique</em> was published by Estienne in 1554 as <em>Praedium Rusticum</em>, a collection of agricultural insights gleaned from classical sources. <em>Praedium Rusticum</em> was translated into French and published posthumously as <em>La maison rustique</em> in 1564 by Estienne’s son-in-law, Jean Liébault. Estienne made some bad business deals and died in debtor’s prison before its publication, but <em>La maison rustique</em> would outlive him as one of the most printed and most popular volumes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries on managing a household on the land.</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Although both <em>La maison rustique</em> and Ms. Fr. 640 have some overlapping preoccupations, the content of the instructions in each text makes clear their different goals. Where the author-practitioner seems to concern himself with either short-term benefits derived from cultivation or piecemeal tidbits about growing things, Estienne gives a more complete treatise on man’s role in the natural world. For example, both works have entries on artichokes, lilies, linseed, grapevines, and chestnuts.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">While Estienne wrote about where and when to plant these items, their specific habitats and the particularities of their soil and climate, the author-practitioner offers advice about when best to harvest them, how others process that harvest, how long the products keep for, and how the ways in which they have been treated can affect their quality. Although some of the author-practitioner’s natural goods are derived from well-tended farms and fields, his interest lies in working with the products of those spaces rather than maintaining the spaces themselves. He is interested in the land but seems not to be responsible for it.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">To compare these two works, this essay offers a preliminary examination of the organization and contents of their respective entries and points to areas for further research. The guiding questions are simple: why might each author have included the entries he did? And, what information is necessary for a recipe to be useful? We can get closer to answering these questions by close reading and thinking through the characteristics of each book.</span></p>

<p><span dir="ltr">In <em>La maison rustique</em>, Estienne offers a holistic account of the world of farming in early modern France. From the building of the farmhouse to the keeping of peacocks to the job of the mule-driver, Estienne seems to want to prepare the reader for every eventuality, to cover everything one might need to know about keeping a farm.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">His writing style enhances this ambition: Estienne has written not just instructions but a narrative of long, connected soliloquies on the physical world, the attitude with which to work the land, and the understanding and temperament that a person should have in order to do this job. His chapters present discrete subjects, but their contents can be long-winded and philosophical.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This conceptual underpinning is enhanced with simpler tips and tricks for doing the job well.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> <em>La maison rustique</em> is not a step-by-step manual but a guide to the construction of a peaceable kingdom in which temperaments are regulated, diseases are cured, and crops prosper in a harmonious, cyclical relationship.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">By contrast, Ms. Fr. 640 is a compendium of disparate tricks, suggestions, experiments, and advice.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Whereas the intended result of each of Estienne’s entries is sewn into the fabric of the text under a neat, organized book and chapter heading, Ms. Fr. 640 does not have the same explicit structure.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Where <em>La maison rustique</em> is a completed, published work, Ms. Fr. 640 is perhaps a step in an ongoing work-in-progress. The manuscript does not appear to be a first draft; it displays some evidence of editing, but it is not complete. The author-practitioner may have been preparing his work for publication, writing it up for a private patron, or compiling a working notebook for a practitioner. For example, he sometimes instructs himself to “try” a process, notes when processes are “<em>non bona</em>,” and makes marginal additions or amendments.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Still, while the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 tend to be shorter and blunter than Estienne’s flowing prose, there are subjects on which the author-practitioner seems to have acquired extensive and detailed knowledge. It is worth investigating what each author considers to be important information to record within each entry.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">For Estienne, some of the most essential information to include relates to the quality of the soil, the shape that gardens and orchards should take, and the daily tasks involved in maintaining the health of cultivated plots of land. He discusses these topics with regard to vegetable gardens and vineyards as well as orchards and forests.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">When speaking about animals, he gives information about how to care for them when they fall ill, how to feed them, when they breed, and how to ensure the continuation of that population.</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Sometimes he makes a particular point to discuss the end product of a given instruction, as when he discusses which wines are good to use as medicine. There are, however, some areas of the text where he is brusque. In a recipe for attracting turtles, Estienne directs the reader to take salts of ammonia, onion, and veal grease and to make little balls with the odiferous mixture, which are then rolled towards the turtles in order to induce them to approach.</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This instruction is similar to Ms. Fr. 640 in its single-minded approach and direct tone, but it earns its own chapter heading in <em>La maison rustique</em>.</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">While the recipe is detailed in its amounts (<em>huit drachmes</em>) and specific in terms of the shape of the turtle bait (<em>pilules en forme de febues</em>), it does not mention why one would want to attract turtles, why turtles are attracted to strong scents, or any other information about breeds of turtles, their care, or their health.</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">A concern for results seems to drive the author-practitioner, determining what information he chooses to include in his entries. He mentions qualities such as beauty and profit when evaluating the intended products of his recipes. For example, on fol. &lt;46r&gt;, the author-practitioner gives a recipe for “Flowers of trees.”</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">At the end of a list of medical and cosmetic advice, a small section gives counsel on grafting for the production of better flowers. The author-practitioner says that grafts must be made sparsely: “Those that are seen with every new ☾ [moon] scarcely come to profit. One ought to leave only two buds on the graft.” It is not clear from this instruction what the “profit” of the flowers might be. It seems as though the author-practitioner is saying that grafted flowering trees which are allowed to bud too often produce inferior flowers. But inferior in what way? What is the use to which they might be put?</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner has similar concerns when it comes to living creatures as well. Where Estienne is occupied by farmyard birds raised for eating, hunting, or decoration, the author-practitioner concerns himself with songbirds and other small birds that would not suit well for those purposes. These types of birds would be more suited to keep as pets or for the pleasing effect of their song or the color of their feathers (a lucrative trade in the early modern world). They might also be used as other animals in Ms. Fr. 640, to create an artificial semblance of life in an ornament such as a metal lifecast. The recipes that concern their treatment and capture give us a few clues as to why the author-practitioner found them useful.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In two entries entitled “Birds,” both on fol. &lt;49v&gt;, the author-practitioner notes small details about a variety of birds, such as larks and turtle-doves. He explains when to catch them, both in their life cycle and the cycle of the year (young, so that they are not yet wild; before Michaelmas or “they scarcely live,” or, alternatively, between All Saints’ Day and Christmas). He describes a malady to which they are prone and a means to remedy it. He also takes pains to describe their likes and dislikes, what they like to eat, when they like to breed, and what particular type of sand they prefer to take a dust bath in. In these entries, the only references to what the birds might be useful for is the preoccupation with their singing and the note that one might want to “fatten them for selling.” He continues the bird theme on the next page, fol. &lt;50v&gt;, with an entry on “Small birds,” and on fol. &lt;98v&gt; with another discussion of “Birds.” In the former, he mentions which breeds are cheaper or more expensive to keep and substitutions for expensive feed. He mentions their breeding patterns in the wild but not ways to breed them in captivity. Birds seem to be a natural resource to be exploited rather than a renewable possession to be cultivated.</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">It seems that the author-practitioner cares less about husbanding animals than controlling them and making use of them in a short-term sense. In another example, the author-practitioner presents two recipes for making animals follow, “For making a horse follow” on fol. &lt;54v&gt; and “For attracting pigeons” on fol. &lt;66v&gt;.</span><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In each case, the reader is instructed to present the animal with a reward (for horses, a sweet bun; for pigeons, fried hemp seed). These instructions are characteristic of the author-practitioner’s attitude towards controlling animals: find something they want and use it to make them compliant.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">There are sections of the manuscript where the author-practitioner is remarkably descriptive about the care and feeding of a particular plant or animal. It is tempting to take this claim and draw further conclusions about the reasons the author-practitioner had for including such detail in his cultivation recipes. Were the subjects he chose to write about and the details he focused on especially useful to him in some way? There are instructions that describe the use of particular ingredients, the cultivation of which is mentioned elsewhere in the manuscript, but we cannot know whether such entries were intended to be cross-referenced and used in concert. Early in the manuscript, on fol. &lt;46r&gt;, the author-practitioner writes an entry for “Flowers of trees.”</span><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Later, on fol. &lt;120v&gt;, he includes instructions for preserving dried flowers “in the same state all year.”</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> It is not possible to say whether the flowers in the recipe on &lt;46r&gt; could be used in the process on &lt;120v&gt;, but we see a consistent interest across the breadth of the manuscript.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">When discussing pastel woad on fol. &lt;39r&gt;, the author-practitioner goes into great detail. This is one of the only places in the manuscript where the connection between cultivation and result is made explicit, where the knowledge of cultivation comes together with the author-practitioner’s personal praxis.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">He discusses the different regions of France where woad grows as well as giving detailed examples of the way the soil should feel when it is ready for planting.</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">His descriptions carry the reader through the cycle of planting woad, both in terms of specific times of year (woad is to be planted “on Saint Anthony’s Day in January”) and the ripeness and readiness of the plant for harvesting (“when, put in the mouth, it gives a taste as of vinegar”). Most crucially, he indicates the usefulness of woad for dyeing, the quantities one should use when dyeing, and the cost of good quality woad. The author-practitioner does not give attribution for this recipe, so we cannot know whether he acquired this knowledge firsthand or was given it by another person. It may never become clear why the author-practitioner chose to be so detailed in some of his entries and so brief in others, but the difference in tone is instructive. Although the author-practitioner is not always thorough, he does write down the same kinds of information as Estienne does when it suits him. The manuscript is not the same kind of book as <em>La maison rustique</em>, but each can contain similar information presented in comparable formats. This is especially evident in their shared focus on noting the time of year in cultivation recipes and shorthanding entry content by means of job titles.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Both authors take pains to note the time of year in their cultivation entries. Estienne writes an entire chapter on the place and time that each type of fruit tree should be fertilized and planted, while the author-practitioner drops in time-based information throughout his entries on grafting trees.</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In his entry on lilies, he makes note of the fact that bulbs should be broken in their first year in order that they should bloom again in the next.</span><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Another intriguing similarity between the texts is the way each uses jobs as titles for various entries. Book one of <em>La maison rustique</em> contains several chapters that are titled with job descriptions, such as “L’office du fermier” 8b; “L’estat de la fermiere” 9b; “Le coulombier” 19b; “Le bouvier” 21a; “Le porcher” 24b; “Le berger” 25b; “Le chevrier” 27b; “Le muletier” 33b.</span><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">These entries contain information about the temperament a person should have to do each job, a discussion of their importance, and specific recipes for sick animals under their care. The author-practitioner also uses jobs as title headings, for example, “Laboureur” (“Plowman”) on fol. &lt;9r&gt;.</span><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The entry goes on to give the following instructions:</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Because millet is by nature very dry, harvesters beat it most often at night in the cool &amp; by moonlight. Which could not be done with another grain that is wetter, for one must let the sunbeams pass through, and one scarcely beats it until the sun is approaching midday. Quickly after the millet is cut, one needs to plow the earth because the root eats it &amp; makes it lean as much as if the millet was still standing. The ground where the millet has been sown diminishes much in its fertility, which one knows at the next sowing that one makes after that. But above all the grain called <em>pomole</em> in Gascony or <em>baillard</em> in France, makes the earth shake seven years later, according to the common saying. Beans improve &amp; correct the soil, provided that one lets the roots &amp; stems rot in it.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Clearly, this is not the same category of information as Estienne included under his job-title headings. The author-practitioner is relating advice about millet that is quite detailed and specific to certain regions of France. Is it possible that this is advice he received from a plowman and recorded in his book? Perhaps the title heading is a way of attributing the information. Later in the manuscript, on fol. &lt;93r&gt;, the author-practitioner provides an “Observation from rustics.” It notes “that when it freezes on Palm Sunday, it freezes all the months of the year.”</span><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">At first glance, this title heading might seem to indicate direct attribution, as in “Laboureur.” But the term “rustics” is much less specific than “plowman,” and it seems implausible that a fieldworker in the sixteenth-century would refer to himself as a “rustic.” Perhaps, this information was related to the author-practitioner second-hand from someone without farm experience as a kind of generalized axiom.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="recipes-in-context"><span dir="ltr">Recipes in Context</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Estienne participated in the goals of humanist reformers who sought to compile information from antiquity and from the world around them to provide models of behavior for individuals and society. His other works were attempts at comprehensive understandings of human anatomy and the French language. Therefore, we might understand <em>La maison rustique</em> as part of that intellectual project.</span><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Additionally, as Rebecca Bushnell has suggested, at this time, many landowners were responding to increasing economic pressures including higher prices and food shortages, and a literature that prized efficiency and economy in the management of land became ever more popular.</span><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">As a genre, these gardening books were concerned with presenting complete information about the natural world. The combination of these concerns may have informed Estienne’s decision to divide his work into six books, each covering a different area of farming and husbandry.</span><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">By working his way outward from the farmhouse toward the countryside, Estienne was able to offer a comprehensive view of the farmer’s domain, as well as a logical progression for the text, which would organize his recipes in such a way that they could easily be found by a casual reader.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner’s entries on cultivation seem intended to investigate and bend the natural world to his will, not to create a long-term, connected strategy for ongoing productivity. In that spirit, his recipes about cultivation are scattered throughout the manuscript. Sometimes they appear close to each other in the text, suggesting a thematic train of thought or that they may have been consciously grouped together. In other cases, the same topic will appear multiple times, separated by large portions of the text.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">For example, the author-practitioner writes entries about keeping fruits fresh throughout the year on fol. &lt;50r&gt; and again on fol. &lt;121r&gt;.</span><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In the former, he describes the detailed and delicate process of sterilizing glass ampoules and then placing stone fruit within them, sealing the top shut with wax, and leaving them in submerged in water, either in a vat in the cellar in summer or in the bottom of a well in winter. In the latter, the author-practitioner describes a very similar process, but this one has the addition of straw within the container to prevent the glass bottles from breaking. Why would he go to the trouble of writing the same recipe twice in two different sections of the manuscript? It could be that he had forgotten he had already written it once, although this seems unlikely. It is possible that the second recipe presents a second attempt after the first had failed. Or, it might be that there are two good ways of achieving the same result, both worth recording.</span><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">As well as returning to similar ideas and processes across the manuscript, sometimes the author-practitioner seems struck by a thematic connection between seemingly disconnected recipes, collecting them all in the same place. On fol. &lt;71r&gt;, he begins with an entry on amber, followed by another on the knotted roots of the elm tree.</span><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">These are followed by entries on mulled wine, horses, and eau-de-vie.</span><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Judging from their headings alone, these three entries would appear unrelated, but even a brief skim shows their content to follow one entry upon the other. The author-practitioner describes the English practice of mulling wine in vivid language. He goes on to explain that this wine is often drunk by the English because they are unable to get sweet wine shipped to them—the sea voyage being long enough that the wine “is clarified” and loses its taste. Then, he declares that the English give their horses mulled wine in order to invigorate them, and that the Irish do not drink wine at all but “eau-de-vie, which they use almost as habitually as we do wine.” Here, we have a disparate array of subjects: lazy horses, mulling wine, the drinking habits of the Irish, how wine behaves on long sea journeys. Perhaps in no other work would we see such an array of concerns listed together on one page and even logically connected in the mind of the author-practitioner. Whereas some recipes are arranged in a context that does not make sense to a modern reader (the recipe for keeping chestnuts is listed between a Latin saying and a recipe for scented candles, for example), this connected train of thought suggests that the author-practitioner drew associations between the subjects of his entries and potentially considered them thematically linked.</span><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">This overview of significant thematic links and practical divergences between Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>La maison rustique</em> has raised questions about genre as well as the aims and audiences of instructional texts. While there is more research to be done, there are some preliminary conclusions that can be drawn. It appears that Ms. Fr. 640 connects with the genre of the household manual, yet aims to achieve different outcomes. There is significant overlap in the topics covered by both the author-practitioner and Estienne, from the care of animals, trees, and plants, to the preserving of fruits and nuts, to the people who worked the land (see Table 1 above). There is also overlap in the subjects deemed important by both authors: feed, soil quality, time of year, geographic location. However, where Estienne is mostly punctilious about including connections that link his entries to one another, the author-practitioner often leaves us with gaps. Where Estienne attempts to be comprehensive in most of his chapters while leaving some brief (see “Tortues”), the author-practitioner largely keeps his entries brief except for a few notable examples (such as “Pastel woad” on fol. &lt;39r&gt; and “Silkworms” on fols. &lt;53v&gt;–&lt;54r&gt;). Where Estienne attempts to offer breadth and depth of knowledge about the natural world, the author-practitioner concentrates on information that can produce a result in the short term. Estienne lays out the contents of his book in a way that is logical to him and accessible to readers. The author-practitioner groupes entries together in a way that has a logic for him, leaving the reader to dig through his manuscript with more difficulty.</span><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">There are limited claims we can make about why the entries in the author-practitioner’s manuscript appear in the order they do, or why they are sometimes so detailed in one place and elsewhere very short. Can entries like these stand as evidence about his thought process?</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">As Pamela Smith discusses in her article “Why Write a Book?,” the transition between the written word and lived experience, and vice versa, is not a linear one but a series of negotiations.</span><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Books are not just repositories of certain knowledge but are themselves workshops where ideas are generated and tested, and where experiments and hypotheses are recorded or discarded. Whether building a world in Estienne’s <em>maison</em> or building knowledge in the author-practitioner’s <em>boutique</em>, both texts present knowledge about effecting change in the natural world. For Estienne, the goal was to create a universe of productivity in which the landholder could flourish. For the author-practitioner, the goal is not entirely clear, but his primary preoccupation seems to be the creation of effects. <em>La maison rustique</em> needed to be as comprehensible as possible in order to be a good investment for the publisher, seller, and consumer. Ms. Fr. 640 apparently had no such constraints, not even as a manuscript exemplar to be copied and re-copied.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">As Smith points out, one goal of practical knowledge and how-to books was to convey how to generalize and improvise in preparation for the unknown.</span><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">While each of these books takes a different attitude towards the primary utility of its contents, each can be seen as preparing its reader for what to expect when carrying out his own work.</span><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>

In the German lands, household matters were also a means to preserve the social order. Connections between the <em>hausvater</em>, patriarchal master of the home, the <em>landesvater</em>, the government as master of the nation, and God the Father as master of the earthly plane, were seen to fit together in a metaphorical framework to explain the ordered working of the world.

<li id="fn10" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">This reprinting did not reproduce the contents of <em>Praedium Rusticum</em> but instead significantly changed the organization and content of the entries. The genre builds on a classical tradition of classification and categorization of the domestic (Latin: <em>domus</em>, the household) which began with treatises on the organization of the home, the state, and the body itself. <em>Praedium Rusticum</em> reproduced classical texts in this tradition, but <em>La maison rustique</em>, like other popular works the household manual genre, interwove philosophical and ideological concerns with practical everyday advice. Interestingly, near the beginning of <em>La maison rustique,</em> Estienne describes the habits of hens and the good order of a well-maintained henhouse. As he details ways to cure sicknesses and how frequently to clean a henhouse, he includes a small marginal heading entitled <em>secrets de nature</em>, under which he describes a method from “Columelle,” the Roman agriculturist Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella (4 – c. 70 AD), which requires a laurel leaf or a head of garlic to be placed in with the hens while they are broody to induce them to lay well. This is the only time the word “secret” is used in <em>La maison rustique,</em> and it references knowledge gained not by the experience of the everyday farmer but from a classical authority. A comparison of <em>La maison rustique</em> to works influenced or inspired by it in France over the next two centuries yields: Louis Liger (1658–1717), <em>General Economy of the Country, or New</em> Maison Rustique, harking directly back to the title of Estienne’s work. Olivier de Serres (1539–1619) did not make the connection quite so explicit in his important book on the management of the land published only a few decades after <em>La maison rustique</em>: Olivier de Serres, <em>Le Théâtre d’agriculture et Mésnage Des Champs d’Olivier de Serres, Seigneur Du Pradel</em> (Paris, 1600), <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k52175n"><span class="underline">https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k52175n</span></a>; Louis Liger, <em>OEconomie Générale de La Campagne, Ou Nouvelle maison rustique.

These folios contain names of people, both artisans and classical and contemporary authors, as well as book titles. The relationship of these folios to the rest of the manuscript is not clear.

<li id="fn17" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">Francisco Alonso-Almeida gives a useful account of the genre of the English recipe book, also very actively produced at this time. Although his work focuses on the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, some of his claims apply to Ms. Fr. 640. The recipe book as a conceptual object is a part of what Almeida calls a “discourse colony,” a genre of text whose utility is derived from the relationships between its component parts. Like a shopping list, the meaning of each component part is unchanged by the order in which it appears within the whole, but each part contributes to the function of the text at large. Ms. Fr. 640 can be understood in light of this model. The tone of the author-practitioner’s writing shifts between different sections of his work, which concern subjects such as weaponry, taxidermy, and casting in metal. See Francisco Alonso-Almeida, “Genre conventions in English recipes, 1600–1800,” in <em>Reading and Writing Recipe Books, 1550–1800</em>, eds. Michelle DiMeo and Sara Pennell (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2013), 68–90.</span><a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">There is evidence that the author-practitioner may have intended his manuscript to be printed and published, such as the use of headings, language which addresses a reader, and notes which might be preparatory to an introductory dedication (fols. &lt;1r&gt;, &lt;162r&gt;, and &lt;166r&gt;). Nevertheless, the form in which we have the text remains unconstrained by the logic of a publishing process. On fol. &lt;166r&gt;, the collection of notes that might be intended for a preface follow the same conventions that Estienne does, justifying reasons for bringing this information together in a particular way. The author-practitioner compares the work of an author to a hen distributing to her chicks: “As the hen carefully searches the garbage thrown out of a house for a crumb or a grain that she divides among her chicks, thus one distributes to orphans that which has been sought among the arts considered vile &amp; abject.” He also compares it to a farmer who has left some ears of corn in the field as a way to explain his role as both a compiler and distributor of secrets: “If something is omitted: the harvester is not reproached for leaving some ears of wheat.” While it is true that Ms. Fr. 640 is an unfinished manuscript, that should not imply that <em>La maison rustique</em> is a closed book, so to speak. Recall that the edition from which this essay draws was printed in 1564 after Estienne’s death. It was edited and published by his son-in-law, Jean Liébault, who took Estienne’s original Latin work and remade it. <em>La maison rustique</em> would remain in print for decades, inspiring translations and reworked editions. While Ms. Fr. 640 perhaps does not exist in what might have been its “final” stage, neither does <em>La maison rustique</em>. Discussions of finality in collaborative texts like recipe books and books of secrets are not always productive, and indeed the Making and Knowing Project is concerned with yet another layer of editing, conversation, and reshaping of its central text in creating this digital critical edition.</span><a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn48" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">As Roger Chartier has shown, in the period in which either of these texts was written, there was no notion that a singular author was responsible for a text. Instead, whether manuscript or print, books were the site of conversation between multiple contributors, from assistants and apprentices to copyists, booksellers, and publishers. Similarly, the contents of books such as <em>La maison rustique</em> or Ms. Fr. 640 were not presented as the work of a solitary mind. Perhaps instead these books act as conversations—about social roles, forms of knowledge, and art and nature. The Making and Knowing Project demonstrates that the life of a text does not end when it is published, or when the original author stops adding to it. See Smith, “Why Write a Book?,” 39; See also, Roger Chartier, <em>The Order of Books: Readers, Authors, and Libraries in Europe between the Fourteenth and Eighteenth Centuries</em>, trans. Lydia G.
