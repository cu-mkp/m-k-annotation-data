<h4 id="carl-garris"><span dir="ltr">Carl Garris</span></h4>
<p><span dir="ltr">In twenty-two entries in Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner uses the term <em>azur</em> when discussing blue pigments. <em>Azur</em> refers to the color blue in French, but also is connected to the French term for azurite, a specific material used as a blue pigment mainly composed of copper carbonate, isolated from a naturally occurring ore. The author-practitioner may simply mean azurite when he uses <em>azur</em>, but he could also mean other contemporary materials. The author-practitioner had access to a variety of other blues in sixteenth-century Toulouse, including verditer (a synthetic copper carbonate), lapis lazuli (a mineral from Afghanistan) and smalt (crushed blue glass).</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Fortunately, the author- practitioner sometimes qualifies <em>azur</em> with additional language: <em>azur desmail</em>, <em>esmail dazur</em>, <em>vert dazur</em>, <em>azur vray</em> and <em>cendres dazur</em>, among others. Analyzing these qualifications can help us better understand the physical meaning of <em>azur</em> in the manuscript.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">At the outset, we do not know whether the author-practitioner distinguishes pigments (e.g., <em>cendres dazur</em> referring to verditer and <em>azur vray</em> referring to lapis lazuli) or merely different grades of the same pigment resulting from different states of grinding or washing in a process known as levigation, which separates different-sized particles.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">While historical research can give us an idea of how people distinguished blues in the sixteenth century, we cannot know through terminological analysis alone whether the author-practitioner used the language in the same way as his contemporaries.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The qualitative nature of the author-practitioner’s observations hinders us from judging definitively how they correspond to different materials. For instance, the author-practitioner frequently speaks of colors “dying.” What does this term mean? Our natural assumption is that blue “dies” when it becomes a lighter shade of blue. Modern physical and spectral analysis gives us a quantitatively defined “ideal blue,” but this modern conception of blue almost certainly differs from the author-practitioner’s due to our exposure to synthetic and digital blues as well as to our spectral understanding of color. For the author-practitioner, as we discuss below, lapis lazuli most likely represented the “ideal blue,” used in the most expensive and high quality paintings on canvas, panel, or parchment. Reconstructions of the <em>azur</em> entries can give us a better idea of what pigments the author-practitioner might be referring to, as they can test, or at least provide clues about, the various qualitative properties of pigments that the author-practitioner describes. Neither of these approaches—historical or experimental—nor a combination of the two can, however, answer this question definitively.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">This essay has three parts. First, a historical linguistic investigation of <em>azur</em> as a term helps give context for common usage during the sixteenth century, although the author-practitioner may have adopted an idiosyncratic, personal usage of <em>azur</em>. The possibility that he derived recipes from other sources complicates any assumption we can make about the consistent use of terminology across the various recipes. We will therefore investigate whether the experimental evidence proves irreconcilable with common usage by reconstructing the manuscript entries involving <em>azur</em> with the four most likely blue pigments (azurite, verditer, lapis lazuli and smalt). As a basis for this experimentation, we must conduct a second stage of linguistic research, in which we analyze the <em>azur</em> entries in the manuscript to identify patterns in the author-practitioner’s language (i.e., to isolate <em>azur</em> from <em>azur desmail</em> and from <em>cendres dazur</em>). We can then identify points in the reconstruction process at which a pigment should behave as the author-practitioner notes, for example, that <em>cendres dazur</em> dies in oil (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><span class="underline">11r</span></a>). This reconstruction of some of the <em>azur</em> entries forms the third section of this essay. Once we complete these three lines of inquiry, we can then attempt to discern what patterns govern the relationship of <em>azur</em> and specific pigments throughout the manuscript. We can get a sense of how the author-practitioner uses <em>azur</em>, but we will never be able to achieve enough data to adequately demonstrate a 1:1 correspondence between terms and materials. Through this investigation, the ambiguous nature of blue in sixteenth-century artwork becomes clear. From reconstructing the <em>azur</em> entries, which typically mention blue in the context of painting, we get a sense of the high level of skill that sixteenth-century painting required. As the author-practitioner does not seem to have been a professional painter, our difficulty in preparing usable paints and then successfully painting them out perhaps sheds light on his own difficulties; hence, this may provide evidence that he experimented with various techniques.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">From the investigation outlined below, we can tentatively conclude that <em>cendres dazur</em> corresponds to verditer and that <em>azur vray</em> corresponds to azurite. Although research on <em>esmail</em> suggests that <em>azur desmail</em> denotes smalt, experimental inquiry has so far yielded no persuasive evidence in the lab for this conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="azur-in-the-sixteenth-century"><span dir="ltr"><em>Azur</em> in the Sixteenth Century</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Modern terminology has been standardized in reference to blue and blue pigments; sixteenth-century makers and artists had a very different understanding. In modern nomenclature, azurite is <em>azurite</em> in French, <em>Azurit</em> in German, <em>azzurrite</em> in Italian, and <em>azzurro</em> in Spanish.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Chemists give us its chemical formula—Cu<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>—which they call copper carbonate.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In mines, it co-occurs both with another copper carbonate, malachite, which has the chemical formula Cu<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> , and with other impurities.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">To make use of this blue pigment, we must separate the malachite from the azurite, as well as the smaller, less blue azurite particles from the larger, brighter azurite particles through a process called levigation. Should we not know if a blue pigment actually comes from azurite, we have a multitude of scientific processes which can give us the answer: microchemical tests, emission spectrographic analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, visual spectrophotometry, neutron activation analysis and others.</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">But sixteenth-century artists obviously did not understand azurite in these same terms. We can make the same point for all the blue pigments under consideration—smalt, lapis lazuli, verditer. To comprehend how sixteenth-century artists conceived of blue pigments, we must investigate how they talked about them.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The number of names early modern artists used to refer to the same pigments are disconcerting. To refer to azurite, they might say mountain blue, <em>bleu d’Allemagne</em>, <em>azzurro della magna</em>, <em>lapis armenius</em>, <em>bergglasur</em>, or <em>azurium citramarinum</em>.</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">To speak of lapis lazuli, they might use Armenian blue, ultramarine, blue stone, or azure spar;</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">for verditer, green bice, blue bice, Bremen blue, cendres blue, ashes blue;</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">and for smalt, <em>email</em>, <em>esmail</em>, <em>azur</em> <em>a poudrer</em>, <em>bleu demail</em>, <em>kaiserblau</em>, or <em>eschel.</em></span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">With so many names in use, it makes sense to categorize blues on the basis of their qualities rather than simply their material identity. All of these pigments are blue, even if they come from different sources. From this survey, we can also appreciate the potential ambiguity the multiple terms poses to historians: both smalt and azurite had names associated with Germany, for instance. All the same, we should not forget the strong prestige of lapis lazuli in particular. Material certainly mattered when people knew what they were working with.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In medieval Europe, artists chose between ultramarine/lapis lazuli (used in the finest manuscripts) and azurite (a cheaper, but still deeply-hued substitute).</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Painters sought out lapis lazuli, almost universally hailed as the best blue, for the highest quality productions.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Azurite often produced equally intense blues, although its frequent impurities and the greater ease with which it could be processed likely contributed to its cheaper price. Because it could be difficult to tell lapis lazuli and azurite apart when purchasing, some medieval artists or merchants used a test involving heating a small piece of the rock or lump pigments to distinguish true lapis lazuli from azurite.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Each of the four pigments we consider here—azurite, smalt, lapis lazuli, and verditer—come from different sources and have specific preparations. Europeans could find azurite in numerous places throughout the continent, but most azurite came from the Kingdom of Hungary until the seventeenth century.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Azurite requires levigation during the preparation process in order to yield a blue pigment.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> This levigation process separates the azurite particles from the malachite and cuprite particles, which one typically finds intermixed with azurite in natural ores.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Craftspeople ground azurite ore down and then washed it in solutions of soap, gum and lye, which helped speed the levigation process.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The soap, in particular, aided in separating the larger blue particles from the smaller impurities.

<p><span dir="ltr">Smalt, made from crushed glass, was a relatively new pigment in the sixteenth century. It likely began to be produced in the fifteenth century.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The blue glass, which craftspeople had to grind to a coarse state to use as a pigment, came from cobalt oxide, which was obtained from roasting cobalt ore and was then mixed into molten glass.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">By the sixteenth century, most smalt producers operated out of the Netherlands.</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Though smalt produced a beautiful blue color, its nature as a potash glass made it likely to degrade over time in color to a pale or even gray blue.</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Lapis lazuli was <em>ultra marine</em>—that is, from across the sea, brought by traders from distant Persia.</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It required a more complicated washing process, as native lapis lazuli, when powdered, is a gray color from calcite and iron pyrite impurities.</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">To separate the blue from the impurities, the craftsperson mixed the crushed lapis with a waxy oil paste under water, causing the blue to come free in the water.</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Though lapis lazuli never surpassed azurite in volume used, it dwarfed it in prestige; it constituted the gold standard to which artists compared other blues.</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Lapis lazuli’s high value came from its distant origin, cost and durability, and its use reflected the status, wealth and possibly devotion of the painter or the painter’s patron.</span><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">It seems unlikely that the author-practitioner used lapis lazuli for the entries we are considering because he does not use any of the language typically associated with the rare Afghan blue, nor does he describe its production process. Thus azurite, smalt, or verditer seem the most likely candidates. Though we have discussed azurite and smalt, verditer requires explanation. By the end of the medieval period, synthetic copper carbonate blues—verditer—frequently appeared in artwork.</span><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Although considered the “poor man’s” alternative, verditer nevertheless can produce a brilliant blue color.</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Moreover, due to its chemical similarity to azurite, scientific analysis cannot always tell the two apart.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">If contemporary artists needed tests to distinguish lapis lazuli and azurite (two separate minerals), it seems likely they also needed to distinguish azurite and verditer (both copper carbonates).</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">We can get a sense of the author-practitioner’s understanding of the “ideal” blue through examining Renaissance artwork. The finest blue most often went to the robes of the Virgin Mary, a fact corroborated in scientific analysis of some Renaissance paintings; in Filippino Lippi’s <em>The Virgin and Child with Saint John,</em> the artists used azurite paint for the sky and lapis lazuli for the Virgin’s robes.</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In contrast, Botticelli used azurite for the robes of Zenobius and his attendants in <em>Four Scenes from the Early Life of Saint Zenobius</em>—the blue is nevertheless beautiful, and Botticelli clearly appreciated it enough for use in this high-quality painting.</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">We can see verditer and smalt used in seventeenth-century Netherlandish still lifes, in which blues do not occupy a prominent place.</span><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">These examples seem to align with the descriptions of perceived quality of individual pigments in the above secondary sources.</span></p>

<p><span dir="ltr">From the table above, we can see that the author-practitioner qualifies azur in the following ways (from most to least common usage): <em>azur desmail</em> (18); <em>azur</em> (unmodified) (17); <em>esmail dazur</em> (4); <em>cendres dazur</em> (3); <em>azur dacre</em> (2); <em>assiette dazur</em> (1); <em>azur la laque</em> (1); <em>azurs beaulx</em> (1); <em>bel azur</em> (1); <em>crouler lazur</em> (1); <em>glacer dazur</em> (1); <em>le fonds dazur</em> (1); <em>mineralles dazur</em> (1) <em>seures azures</em> (1); <em>subtil de lazur</em> (1); <em>vermeillon azur</em> (1); <em>vert dazur</em> (1); and <em>vieulx azur</em> (1). Of these, we will focus on terms appearing more than once, which can best help us interpret a pattern of usage. These are <em>azur desmail</em>, <em>azur</em>, <em>esmail dazur</em>, <em>cendres dazur</em> and <em>azur d’acre</em>. <em>Azur desmail</em> and <em>esmail dazur</em> seem related to enamel in terms of language, which perhaps suggests smalt.</span><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">As discussed in a previous research essay, the making of enamel in the Renaissance involved molten glass, hence the connection between <em>azur desmail</em> and smalt.</span><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> <em>Cendres dazur</em> or “azure ashes” might refer to any number of blue pigments of different provenance described as “ashes” in various languages, including verditer, which can be made from the runoff from azurite mines (mentioned on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><span class="underline">11r</span></a>), and lower grades of lapis lazuli or azurite.</span><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> <em>Azur d’acre</em> clearly refers to a blue associated (at least in language) with the city of Acre, an important port in Palestine.</span><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">While artists could find verditer, smalt, and azurite in Europe, they had to purchase lapis lazuli from traders who brought it from Afghanistan. Perhaps the long-distance trade which supplied lapis lazuli led to the term <em>azur dacre</em>? Prior research in the Making and Knowing Project has suggested that <em>azur dacre</em> usually referred to mineral blues—lapis lazuli or azurite.</span><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">We need to investigate the historical usage of this term to reach any more definite conclusions.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Amy Chang’s research essay on “Esmail,” suggests that a twenty-first century readership needs to understand sixteenth-century enamel in order to appreciate the author-practitioner’s meaning. However, their reading of <em>azur desmail</em> leans towards identifying it with azurite, which seems unlikely considering insights provided in Ana Matisse Donefer-Hickie’s research on glasswork.</span><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Donefer-Hickie describes how sixteenth-century writers categorized “glass” into two categories, <em>cristallin</em> and <em>émail</em>. <em>Cristallin</em> was clear and expensive, whereas <em>émail</em> was opaque and of lower quality.</span><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In considering the text of Ms. Fr. 640, we cannot discern a clear relationship between <em>azur desmail</em> and <em>esmail dazur</em>. Fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><span class="underline">11r</span></a> begins with <em>esmail dazur</em> in its title but proceeds to use <em>azur desmail</em> in all subsequent mentions of (presumably) the same substance. This usage implies that the author-practitioner used the terms interchangeably. <em>Esmail dazur</em> in a later entry, on fol 38r, seems to suggest a substance used in creating imitation gems. Considering Donefer-Hickie’s claim that <em>émail</em> was used in making glass beads, the author-practitioner’s use of <em>esmail dazur</em> for gem-making further supports its identification with glass, and therefore with smalt. The context tells us that one can melt <em>esmail dazur</em>, suggesting that <em>esmail dazur</em> might refer to the lump form rather than the powder. This deduction is speculative, as one could also melt an already ground pigment.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Of the four most common <em>azur</em> terms, it seems that the author-practitioner systematically distinguishes <em>azur desmail</em> (possibly including <em>esmail dazur</em>), <em>cendres dazur</em> and possibly <em>azur d’acre</em>. In half the instances of <em>azur</em>, however, we only have an unqualified <em>azur</em> or a uniquely occurring term like <em>azur vray</em>. We can see, then, that <em>azur</em> blue constituted an ambiguous and broad category for the author-practitioner—while he certainly distinguished <em>azur desmail</em> as something specific, and probably <em>cendres dazur</em>, we cannot determine if <em>azur</em> refers to anything particular about material identity from his language alone. This idiosyncrasy suggests one of three things: that the author-practitioner simply referred to blue as a category, with little attention to specific materials; that the author-practitioner felt readers would easily understand what blue pigment he intended based on immediate context; or that the author-practitioner consistently identified one pigment with unqualified <em>azur</em> (e.g., possibly azurite) and only specified <em>cendres dazur</em> and <em>azur desmail</em> when he wished to indicate the use of other blue pigments. We must also entertain a final possibility: given that the manuscript may include entries copied from other sources, the author-practitioner may not use <em>azur</em> and its corresponding terms with any consistency.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="experimental-methodology"><span dir="ltr">Experimental Methodology</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">We carried out three experiments to test the statements made by the author-practitioner about the properties and behavior of different blues. These statements seemed possible to test relatively easily, and by this means we thought we would be able to differentiate the various blues. The first experiment reconstructed blue paints from pigments bound in aqueous media and oil to compare change in color between the two; the author-practitioner suggested that <em>cendres dazur</em> in oil should “die,” or lose color, whereas <em>azur vray</em> should keep it (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><span class="underline">11r</span></a>). The second experiment reconstructed a separation method in which we immersed prepared oil paint in water to see if the pigment would separate from the binding medium; the author-practitioner suggested that <em>azur desmail</em> should separate from its binding medium (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59r/f/59r/tl"><span class="underline">59r</span></a>). The third experiment reconstructed a test of pigment quality in which we added pigment to lead white; the author-practitioner suggested that high quality <em>azur desmail</em> should turn the lead white <em>turquine</em> whereas low quality should turn it lavender-gray (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><span class="underline">93v</span></a>).</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="experiment-1-azur-vray-vs.-cendres-dazur"><span dir="ltr">Experiment 1: <em>azur vray</em> vs. <em>cendres dazur</em></span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">To attempt to understand the identity of <em>azur vray</em> and <em>cendres dazur</em> described on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><span class="underline">11r</span></a>, we considered the following text and devised an experimental test to investigate it: “azure ashes are only good for landscapes because they die in oil. Only true azure holds on” (fol. 11r). The author-practitioner provides qualitative properties for “azure ash” here—that it should die (i.e., lose color) in oil, whereas “true azure” should maintain its color. Through preparing the four pigments under consideration in both aqueous and oil media and subsequently analyzing color change, we can procure evidence for the identification of “azure ashes” and “true azure.”</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> We prepared lapis lazuli, two grades of azurite, verditer, and smalt in walnut oil and glair. All pigments were purchased pre-ground from Kremer.</span><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In our reconstruction, we varied the pigments and binding media and attempted to keep all other variables constant. In preparing paints, there are several variables we can control to compare our paints effectively: mass/volume ratios, viscosity, or final color. As final color is our dependent variable, we considered varying viscosity (i.e., the ease with which paint adheres to the brush and releases onto the substrate) and the mass/volume ratio (i.e., the ratio of binding media to pigment). Of these two variables, it seemed the mass/volume ratio would be easier to keep constant. Despite this, the experiment was done twice, using mass/volume first and viscosity in the second iteration (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3)</span></i>.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_060_fa_17/undefined" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 3.

<p><span dir="ltr">Following the procedures outlined on 11r, we prepared paints from each of the four pigments, including two grades of azurite. We created four sets of paints—one set prepared in glair based on mass/volume,</span><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">a second set prepared in walnut oil based on mass/volume, a third set prepared in glair based on viscosity,</span><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">and a fourth set prepared in walnut oil based on viscosity. In all cases, we used one gram of the prepared pigment. In the mass/volume controlled paints, we made use of three grams of binding medium. In the viscosity controlled paints, we added indeterminate amounts of binding media (always exceeding three grams) to achieve proper viscosity for painting. To isolate the pigments in small containers against a white background, we used white plastic palette cups (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_060_fa_17/undefined" alt="fig. 4"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 4.

The rows are: glair by weight, walnut oil by weight, glair by viscosity, walnut oil by viscosity.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">I attempted to compare the color of the prepared paints with my naked eye and using photography corrected for white balance using the GIMP GNU Manipulation Program; this program translated the color of the paints into RGB values, thus representing the intensity of red, green, and blue light reflected by each surface respectively on a scale of 0 (none) to 255 (greatest intensity). Using the GIMP GNU Manipulation Program, the average value of a 3-pixel radius circle in the center of each well was taken and tabulated. Based on the data, it seems that azurite suffered the least change—starting dark and ending slightly darker—when bound in an oil medium rather than glair. Verditer, by contrast, shows the change more clearly both to the naked eye and under RGB-value analysis, going from a bright blue to a dark blue in oil while darkening substantially less in glair. Might azurite be the “true azure” while <em>cendres dazur</em> refer to verditer? As discussed above, verditer served as a synthetic substitute for azurite in the sixteenth century and typically appears in lower quality works than does azurite.</span><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It is also one of the pigments sometimes described as “ashes.”</span><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The difference between azurite’s behavior and that of verditer is clear to the naked eye, even without the support of analysis of RGB color values.</span><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This test, unfortunately, tells us little about lapis lazuli and smalt, which each show only a slight difference when bound in oil and glair, respectively. Perhaps that lack of change is the author-practitioner’s point, if he indeed refers to azurite and verditer by <em>azur vray</em> and <em>cendres dazur</em>.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While I had initially planned to assess the color change of the pigments in oil and glair by applying the paints I prepared to various supports (e.g., paper, canvas, panel), additional variables introduced by the painting process itself complicated this and thus prevented me from drawing any firm conclusions.</span><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Nevertheless, other insights emerged: whereas painting in oil proved intuitive and somewhat forgiving (one can apply paint onto a support and spread it around without it drying), glair posed several difficulties. Early attempts at painting in glair resulted in lumpy and uneven surfaces of paint. At the advice of Jo Kirby, we practiced painting first with modern watercolors and later with reproduction sixteenth-century paints. In accordance with her advice, we deduced that small strokes, quickly applied and in multiple coats, best achieve a deep, even color. The labor and precision required surprised us, revealing that painting even a uniform surface requires skill.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="experiment-2-azur-desmail-immersion"><span dir="ltr">Experiment 2: <em>azur desmail</em> immersion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">On folio 59r, the author-practitioner writes that “Azur d’esmail tempered in oil, leaves it &amp; returns to its primary nature if you mix it in water” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/59r/f/59r/tl"><span class="underline">59r</span></a>). This prescription seems fairly straightforward; a prepared paint of <em>azur desmail</em>, once immersed in water, should separate back into oil and <em>azur desmail</em> powder. An alternate reading, however, might relate “primary nature” to color change. To test this observation, we prepared paint in walnut oil from azurite, lapis lazuli, smalt and verditer (using pigments from Kremer). We then placed this paint into the bottom of beakers, which we then filled quickly with water. We did this immediately, without allowing the pigments to dry. After letting them sit for several days, however, we did not see that the pigment had separated fully from the oil, though some oil had collected on top of the water.</span><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It seems that we either misinterpreted what “returns to its primary nature” means or that we should have added the paint to the water rather than vice versa. To determine anything further from this experiment, we would need to do more tests.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="experiment-3-lead-white-test"><span dir="ltr">Experiment 3: lead white test</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Finally, we attempted to test for high quality <em>azur desmail</em> outlined by the author-practitioner on folio <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/93v/f/93v/tl"><span class="underline">93v</span></a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Azur d’esmail always wants to be cleaned because the filth that can be seen in the <em>laveures</em> [washings] makes it die. One needs to coat it two times, &amp; the first very thick, moving the pinceau by laying it first lengthwise then across. It is better used on canvas, where it is imbibed immediately, than on wood. Varnish returns it to its vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To try it, painters bring their palette to the grocers, &amp; distemper &amp; alloy it with a little white ground in oil,</span><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">for in this way, the beautiful shows its turquine vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most delicate is the best for working. It is thinned by washing it.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">To replicate this procedure, we mixed verditer, azurite, lapis lazuli and smalt with a teaspoon of commercial lead-white oil paint.</span><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Due to the highly dominant nature of the white paint, we had to add several grams of each pigment to prompt any color change at all. Azurite, lapis lazuli and smalt all produced a pale purple color, but the verditer produced a pale turquoise. While these properties suggest that the verditer might correspond to the “beautiful” turquine pigment, it seems counterintuitive as verditer was a cheaper substitute for the “real” azurite. We should avoid lending too much credence to this experiment as it potentially suffers from confounding variables. First, the lavender-turquoise divide might exist between different qualities of the same pigment, rather than between different pigments. Second, we used too great a proportion of lead-white paint to pigment due to underestimating lead-white’s strong masking ability. We should also note that <em>couleur turquine</em>, according to Randle Cotgrave’s 1611 dictionary, referred to a “right blue, or Venice blue; the colour of Turkie Stone.”</span><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">As our paint turned a color more easily recognizable as modern turquoise, it may not be the color described by the author-practitioner. Doing this reconstruction again with less lead-white paint and also with multiple grades of each pigment could help achieve a less problematic result (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_060_fa_17/undefined" alt="fig. 5"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 5.

<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">By investigating <em>azur</em> in Ms. Fr. 640, we can get a sense of sixteenth-century artists’ and makers’ often ambiguous use of “blue” as a category for colors and pigments. Historical research suggests that <em>cendres azur</em> likely corresponds to verditer or lower-grade azurite or lapis, and <em>azur desmail</em> likely corresponds to smalt. We can tentatively speculate that unqualified <em>azur</em> refers to azurite. From historical investigation of <em>azur</em> in the sixteenth century, textual analysis of <em>azur</em> in the manuscript and reconstructions of a few of the <em>azur</em> entries, we can tentatively identify <em>cendres dazur</em> with verditer and <em>azur</em> with azurite. Historical and textual analysis suggest that <em>azur desmail</em> corresponds to smalt, but we yet lack any experimental findings to support such a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> The experience of attempting to reconstruct sixteenth-century blue paints and then of actually painting them out in a uniform fashion reveals the difficulty of using the evidence of experimental reconstruction in assessing historical documents and linguistic usage. Despite my expectation that modern materials and technical methods of analysis would help distinguish between the different materials, it became clear that the most important factor may actually have been my own lack of expertise in painting. Because I was learning as I went, and I did not have time to achieve skillful application of egg-based or oil-based paints, I could not draw definitive conclusions. Just as significant, we do not know the author-practitioner’s own level of painterly skill, his knowledge of the terms for <em>azur</em>, his familiarity with any of the pigments in question, nor whether he had firsthand experience using them. In sum, then, the author-practitioner’s different terms for blues on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><span class="underline">11r</span></a> must remain obscure. Avenues for further research include the author-practitioner’s interest in different blues, the mention of painters bringing their palettes to grocers, and the apparent familiarity that the author-practitioner has with the making of synthetic blues in his discussion of making blues from “rock water.” If the author-practitioner was indeed familiar with making verditer, it would shed light on his discussion of <em>azur</em> throughout the manuscript.</span></p>
