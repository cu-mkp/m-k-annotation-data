<p><span dir="ltr">Like other substances that are capable of changes of state from solid to malleable to liquid, wax has a long history, traceable back to antiquity, not only as a material destined for a myriad of making processes, but also as a flexible metaphor.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This essay explores the material and discursive versatility of wax in Ms. Fr. 640. Central to our inquiry is a mixture of wax, charcoal, and sulfur, which the author-practitioner introduces on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a> and refers to as “black sulfured wax.” By addressing this particular case, we focus on the use of wax as a chief ingredient for compounds.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This is just one of the wax-based compounds in the manuscript’s entries and marginal notes. About a quarter of the entries that mention wax actually treat wax compounds. This raises the questions: what distinguishes black sulfured wax from wax alone and from other wax compounds? Why and how does the author-practitioner arrive at creating black sulfured wax? By extension, how does he treat wax as a material, as a term, and as an idea? Our method of investigation is twofold. Through a close reading of the entry, we contextualize black sulfured wax in relation to other wax compounds in the manuscript and in earlier and contemporary treatises. Then, through a reconstruction of the entry, we evaluate some of the author-practitioner’s descriptions of black sulfured wax.</span></p>

<h2 id="wax-compounds-in-the-manuscript-and-black-sulfured-wax"><span dir="ltr">Wax Compounds in the Manuscript and Black Sulfured Wax</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">A text search through the manuscript affirms that wax was a commonly used material for early modern artisans and artists.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The word <em>cire</em> and its two cognates <em>ciree</em> and <em>enciree</em>—both used to refer to waxed fabric or paper—appear 283 times in 108 entries and marginal notes.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Among them twenty-nine entries and marginal notes refer to wax compounds (mixtures of wax and at least one other ingredient). Twenty-two of these list ingredients and offer instructions with varying degrees of specificity. Of the remaining seven entries and marginal notes, two mention compounds whose ingredients are listed elsewhere in the manuscript. The other five refer to compounds whose ingredients are not listed anywhere in the manuscript; two of them list such wax compounds alongside other materials for creating new mixtures.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Color is a significant aspect of wax compounds in the manuscript. In nineteen entries and marginal notes, wax compounds have colors in their names and/or include coloring ingredients. Explicitly stated by the author-practitioner on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a> and in a marginal note on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/153r/f/153r/tl"><span class="underline">153r</span></a>, one reason for adding color is to allow details to appear more clearly when cast, carved, or imprinted with a seal.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In some cases, the author-practitioner chooses a coloring agent also for its physical property. On fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159r/f/159r/tl"><span class="underline">159r</span></a>, for example, he recommends mixing wax with lead white rather than ceruse, because the former is “firmer &amp; whiter.”</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Firmness here is possibly a reference to the desired carvability in this particular kind of wax.</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Black is mentioned more often than any other color. There is some ambiguity, however, among the nine entries and marginal notes referring to compounds that are described as black or have black ingredients:</span></p>

</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p><span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Note that the author-practitioner uses the words “black” and “wax” in a number of configurations and with additional words and phrases. In two entries on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/165r/f/165r/tl"><span class="underline">165r</span></a>, for example, the word “black” is used as a qualifier interchangeable with “gray.” In a marginal note on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150v/f/150v/tl"><span class="underline">150v</span></a>, by contrast, the term “black wax” appears to refer to a specific compound. Whereas the author-practitioner offers a quantified recipe (as will be discussed below) on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a> for “black sulfured wax”—named as such in an accompanying marginal note, and mentioned again on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/151r/f/151r/tl"><span class="underline">151r</span></a>—he does not specify the ingredients, their ratio, or the making procedures for other compounds. It is thus impossible to determine overlaps and to count exactly how many discrete compounds in addition to black sulfured wax are mentioned. The noun phrase “black wax” appears to refer to multiple material variants rather than to a singular compound.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Earlier and contemporary treatises are similarly ambiguous about wax compounds that are described as black or have black ingredients. Cennino Cennini (late 1390s) mentions a mixture of wax and “ship pitch” for modeling on a wall.</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Vannoccio Biringuccio (1540) refers to a composition of wax and “Greek pitch or ship’s tar” for modeling a three-dimensional object rather than a relief.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Giorgio Vasari (1550) suggests a more complex amalgamation of wax, animal fat, turpentine, and black pitch also as a modeling material.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Hugh Platt (1653) lists “yellow wax tempered with the fine powder of smale cole” as a casting material.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">By contrast, Benvenuto Cellini (1568) mentions “black wax” three times in his treatises but does not explain what it consists of. His black wax has three different uses: a work surface, a molding material, and an imprinting material.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">These examples allow a modest conclusion: mixing wax with a black substance is a practice common among artisans.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Adding color, however, is where the commonality ends. Just as the additive can vary from powdered charcoal to viscoelastic ship pitch, the mechanical behavior and use of the final product range from soft modeling material to hard casting material. The variability of black wax in the comparative sources thus corresponds to the multiple and ambiguous occurrences of “black wax” in the manuscript. It follows that “black wax” may not even refer to a specific set of variations but an idea that can be materialized into additional permutations through experimentation.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Black sulfured wax constitutes a particular embodiment of this idea. Fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a> is unusual because it not only lists ingredients for black sulfured wax but also offers a mixing ratio. The author-practitioner recommends half the amount of powdered charcoal to wax. He then instructs using as much sulfur as a large walnut for each full eared-porringer of melted wax. While neither a walnut nor an eared-porringer can be considered standardized volumetric measures, this specificity is unique among all wax compound entries in the manuscript. The ratio allows the amount of the ingredients to be scaled according to need.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">That the name <em>cire noire soufrée</em> is given in a marginal note also distinguishes black sulfured wax from other wax compounds, for which names are either given as headings to entries or not at all. If we accept that marginal notes are a form of addendum, it follows that the naming of black sulfured wax took place retroactively, after the author-practitioner began writing instructions for making the compound. Indeed, he appears to have changed his mind in the process of writing fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a>. Although the heading “Cast of wax to represent an animal that one has not got” suggests that he would focus on casting, nearly half of the subsequent text (thirty of the total seventy lines) consists of instructions for making black sulfured wax and descriptions of its physical properties. The naming of the compound in the first marginal note (almost aligned with the first line of the main text) thus indicates a momentary transition of his focus and interest towards defining this particular compound or perhaps claiming his intellectual ownership over it. It may capture the moment at which the idea of black wax is materialized into the variant form of black sulfured wax, a compound not found in any earlier or contemporary treatises that we have consulted so far.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In addition, the name “black sulfured wax” is notable for the use of the word <em>soufree</em>. Although both charcoal and sulfur are additives, the name invokes only the latter. Moreover, the participial adjective “sulfured” adds a causal sense: black sulfured wax is black wax treated with sulfur.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The relative emphasis on this ingredient appears to be linked to the author-practitioner’s experiments elsewhere in the manuscript. As Rozemarijn Landsman and Jonah Rowen point out, sulfur is mentioned in several entries and marginal notes in the manuscript, some of which discuss it as a casting material.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Three occurrences in particular mention sulfur and wax. An entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109r/f/109r/tl"><span class="underline">109r</span></a> titled “Wax for molding” suggests pouring sulfur into molten wax and letting the sulfur settle. The process leaves “mixes only its [i.e., the sulfur’s] substance amongst the wax.” The wax, as a result, becomes malleable, melts more easily, and does not produce bubbles when cast. On fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131v/f/131v/tl"><span class="underline">131v</span></a>, in the continuation of an entry, titled “Molded waxes,” the author-practitioner again describes adding sulfur (now molten) to liquid wax and letting the sulfur settle, thereby leaving “its quality” in the wax. These two examples focus on the use of wax after its contact with sulfur. By contrast, a marginal note on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><span class="underline">140v</span></a>, titled “For casting in sulfur,” suggests trying “sulfur passed through melted wax.” Presumably referring to the same process of adding sulfur to wax, the statement now presents the post-contact sulfur as a casting material.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Such comparative examples offer further insights into understanding black sulfured wax. In all three, the author-practitioner acknowledges that sulfur, whether in solid form or liquid form, does not fully dissolve but imparts some other property to the wax. Based on this understanding, he suggests separate uses for the two materials in their altered states after contact. By contrast, his instructions for making black sulfured wax include continuously stirring sulfur when adding it to wax so as not to let it settle. He thus explores three different ways of handling sulfur and wax: letting sulfur pass through wax and using the wax; letting sulfur pass through wax and using the sulfur; agitating the two together until the mixture solidifies so as to keep sulfur suspended in wax. Black sulfured wax, in other words, is an extension of his experiments with sulfur and wax.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The compound is not simply a mixture of materials, but also appears to be a convergence of two different trajectories of experimentation: one of exploring sulfur and wax, and another of exploring black wax. Landsman and Rowen suggest that sulfur in the manuscript metonymically stands for the process of experimentation.</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">By extension, we propose that the participial adjective “sulfured” in “black sulfured wax” highlights the active and transformative nature of this making process. Black sulfured wax is not simply black wax treated with sulfur; it is a concept (<em>cire noire</em>) that takes a new material form through further experimentation (<em>soufrée</em>). It constitutes a particularly notable point of intersection in the complex network of experimentations in the manuscript.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="criteria-for-reconstruction"><span dir="ltr">Criteria for Reconstruction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">For reconstructing black sulfured wax, we first focused on approximating period ingredients. Unlike sulfur, “wax” and “charcoal” are category terms that may refer to multiple variants.</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner strongly recommends using white wax, because it is “firmer &amp; does not leave as much filth” (139v). The practice of bleaching beeswax can be traced back to antiquity. Pliny the Elder in <em>Natural History</em>, for example, explains the process of producing Punic wax, for which beeswax was repeatedly boiled in seawater with soda and dried in the open.</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">By the early modern period, beeswax bleaching was practiced throughout Western Europe, thanks in part to the demand by the Church for candles.</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The earliest record of the term <em>cera alba</em>, still used to refer to bleached wax in general, is from the fourteenth century, and it refers to an even earlier bleaching practice in Venice.</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The process, however, appears to have changed little from Pliny’s time, since an Italian record from 1561 explains that wax should be boiled with seawater and “nitro.”</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In France, Brittany and Anjou were considered to have the best wax bleaching facilities.</span><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Little information, however, is available on specific sixteenth-century French techniques other than the general consensus that exposure to sunlight, water, and oxygen was the most common method.</span><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">For the reconstruction of black sulfured wax, we chose filtered, but not bleached, beeswax, since most bleached beeswax available today goes through modern chemical processes.</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The term charbon most likely refers to wood-based charcoal rather than coal. While the entry in Randall Cotgrave’s <em>A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues</em> (1611) suggests that the term was used interchangeably to mean both materials, Jean Nicot’s <em>Thresor de la langue francoyse</em> (1606) and the first edition of the <em>Dictionnaire de l’Académie française</em> (1694) indicate that charbon refers primarily to charcoal. The etymology of the term in the modern <em>Grand Robert</em> confirms this. Also notable is Biringuccio’s discussion of wood-based charcoal used for metalwork.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">For our reconstruction, we chose stick charcoal (for drawing) made from American northwest hardwood.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">We then focused on approximating the relative ratio of ingredients in modern measurements. For the amount of wax needed for casting, the author-practitioner recommends half the amount of charcoal; he then suggests using as much sulfur as a large walnut for each full eared-porringer of wax. A porringer is a shallow bowl that was first used in the medieval period and continues to be produced today. Among the few extant sixteenth-century porringers that we found in museum collections, we chose an eared English example at the Victoria and Albert Museum (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>). It is 4.4 cm high and has a 13.7 cm diameter, without its ears. We calculated the cylindrical volume and reduced it to 500 ml in order to approximate the volume of the cavity.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_051_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDdlBiaDNwZ2xaLW8.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDdlBiaDNwZ2xaLW8"><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></a>.

<p><span dir="ltr">To determine the volume of a walnut, we depended on modern cookbooks and online cooking resources, as cookie recipes often instruct users to distribute dough in walnut-sized portions.</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Suggested measurements range from one to two tablespoons; we chose two tablespoons, or 30 ml.

<h2 id="experimenting-with-black-sulfured-wax"><span dir="ltr">Experimenting with Black Sulfured Wax</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Our lab activities consisted of three parts: preparation, application of the resultant wax combinations, and evaluation of material properties.</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">We mixed black sulfured wax according to the instructions on <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a>: melt wax and sulfur separately, combine them together, and then add powdered sulfur while continuously stirring the mixture. We then simulated two practical applications using the resulting material, molding and coating, each based on descriptions in the manuscript. We poured the molten material it into two molds (each with four cavities)—the same silicone molds used by Landsman and Rowen in their experiments—and also poured it over a small piece of copper foil (approximately 4 x 4 cm) to test the author-practitioner’s observation that this wax can be used to coat an engraving plate (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140r/f/140r/tl"><span class="underline">140r</span></a>–<a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><span class="underline">140v</span></a>). Once the black sulfured wax set, we tested its physical properties by manipulating it at room temperature and by melting it. We prepared two additional materials to compare with the black sulfured wax: wax with no additives and a compound that we refer to as “sulfur-passed wax.” The latter is based on the author-practitioner’s instructions on fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109r/f/109r/tl"><span class="underline">109r</span></a> and <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/131r/f/131r/tl"><span class="underline">131r</span></a> to add sulfur to wax and let it settle. Given that the author-practitioner does not specify the quantity of ingredients, we appropriated the ratio between wax and sulfur used for black sulfured wax but omitted the charcoal (i.e., 98.0 g of wax to 10.7 g of sulfur).</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The different preparation procedures made it easy to anticipate how the three materials would look when ready to be applied. Black sulfured wax took on the color of charcoal, whereas wax with no additives and sulfur-passed wax showed no notable difference in color. Because it contained a proportionally large amount of charcoal powder, black sulfured wax turned out thicker than molten wax with no additives. Since we did not stir sulfur-passed wax (to keep sulfur separated from wax), we could not check its consistency in the heating vessel to compare to that of wax with no additives.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Pouring into molds brought out differences among the three materials. Wax with no additives flowed most freely, and it was easy to maintain a thin stream when pouring into each mold cavity (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>). Sulfur-passed wax was more viscous. Observation, controllability of the pouring action, and the hand-feel through the heating vessel reminded us of light cream (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>). Black sulfured wax was the least runny. We could not pour the material in a consistent stream; it kept breaking off. The experience was reminiscent of pouring smooth but thick gravy (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_051_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDV1JCbEkxUzJHOWs.jpg" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDV1JCbEkxUzJHOWs"><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></a>.

As we melted and poured black sulfured wax, we noted that the compound was significantly thicker than the two comparative materials.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">During the application phase, we noted further differences among the three materials. In each case, we filled the material just above the rim of each mold cavity, to the point where the surface tension prevented the material from overflowing. As wax with no additives hardened, the exposed surface contracted and eventually formed a slightly concave surface with sharper edges. Sulfur-passed wax and black sulfured wax, by contrast, maintained the convex surface (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>). We also noticed that, because of its thickness, black sulfured wax did not reach some of the narrower parts of the cavity (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>). Pouring over sheets of copper foil confirmed the relative viscosity of the three materials observed when casting into molds. Wax with no additives covered the copper evenly and thinly upon application. The other two materials were harder to pour, as each stream hardened almost as soon as it hit the copper surface.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_051_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDNWZNRkcyR21xNlk.jpg" alt="fig. 5"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDNWZNRkcyR21xNlk"><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></a>.

Cast black sulfured wax in mold. Charles Kang, Making and Knowing Lab, 2016. Black sulfured wax, presumably due to its thickness and temperature, did not reach the smaller crevices of the mold cavities. The compound contracted as it hardened, thereby pulling away from the cavity walls.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">The differences enumerated above were in part due to the respective temperatures of the three materials at the moment of application. Because of the quantity, preparation procedure and safety protocols, sulfur-passed wax and black sulfured wax cooled down in the heating vessel before pouring began. By contrast, we poured wax with no additives straight from the hot plate with no cooling period. Further experiments will have to test the application of the materials at the same temperature to keep this variable consistent. Another factor to consider is the method of applying each material to the sheets of copper foil. Dipping copper foil into the material may produce different results from pouring over copper.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Once the materials set in the molds and on the copper foil, we manipulated them at room temperature. With the cast pieces, we tried cutting, marking, and carving with four different wax carving tools (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>). We also rubbed the cast pieces on a sheet of textured paper. With the copper foil, we made marks that we deemed common to engraving: a straight line, a curved line, an angled closed form, a rounded closed form, and crosshatches. Compared to the wax with no additives and the sulfur-passed wax, the black sulfured wax turned out to be the hardest and the most brittle. It did not cut cleanly: the piece broke as a knife was pushed in halfway, and the broken surfaces looked matte and textured (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>). Carving and inscribing were also difficult, as it resisted the tool and hand, and it produced irregular flakes (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 9)</span></i>. Black sulfured wax rubbed off easily on textured paper, reminding us of a crayon (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 10</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_051_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDc2sxbmprcTNRTkk.jpg" alt="fig. 7"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDc2sxbmprcTNRTkk"><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></a>.

<p><span dir="ltr">In order to test the author-practitioner’s other descriptions, we tried re-melting black sulfured wax. The first attempt consisted of melting the leftover compound that had hardened in the heating vessel after the preparation phase. The temperature range that we chose was too low to melt the compound completely, and we discovered chunks of sulfur that had solidified at the bottom of the heating vessel (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></i>), confirming the author-practitioner’s statement on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140r/f/140r/tl"><span class="underline">140r</span></a> that “the sulfur that you will have put in it, will be found, the second time that you melt it, cracked at the bottom.”</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_051_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDVUI2TkZyMnFGTHc.jpg" alt="fig. 11"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDVUI2TkZyMnFGTHc"><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></a>. Pieces of sulfur found during the melting of leftover black sulfured wax. Charles Kang, Making and Knowing Lab, 2016. While attempting to melt some of the leftover black sulfured wax in the heating vessel, we discovered solid pieces of sulfur. The pieces had registered the contours of the heating vessel; we concluded that sulfur had sunken to the bottom of the vessel and solidified during/soon after the original mixing and casting experiment.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">The second attempt consisted of melting the same leftover compound—minus the sulfur pieces we took out during the first attempt—at a higher temperature. It eventually melted into very thick liquid, which we poured into silicone molds and onto a ceramic plate. To our surprise, the melted and recast compound behaved differently. The cast pieces (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 12)</span></i> registered the details of the mold cavity more clearly than the original black sulfured wax. Their surface was smoother and more lustrous. Even the carving and inscribing tests brought out differences: although not as supple as wax with no additives or sulfur-passed wax, the melted and recast compound was less brittle and more yielding to tools.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_051_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDMUc3WlJ6cFlfeXc.jpg" alt="fig. 12"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDMUc3WlJ6cFlfeXc"><span class="underline">Fig. 12</span></a>. Cast pieces of black sulfured wax with most sulfur taken out. Charles Kang, Making and Knowing Lab, 2016. After taking out the solidified pieces of sulfur, we melted the leftover black sulfured wax completely and poured it into a mold. The resulting pieces took details of the mold cavities much more clearly than freshly made black sulfured wax.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">For the third attempt, we melted cast pieces of the original black sulfured wax, putting each relief piece face-up at the bottom of the heating vessel. We did not agitate the heating vessel. The pieces predictably melted from the bottom up (<i><span class="underline">Vid. 1</span></i>). The relief surface resisted the heat for 5 minutes, longer then we had anticipated from the small size of the cast pieces. Furthermore, the pieces ultimately disintegrated rather than melted—forming a crust at the bottom of the vessel—while retaining a vague outline of the relief (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 13</span></i>). In other words, towards the relief surface the compound had more charcoal and sulfur than wax. Given that the pieces were cast with the relief surface facing down, we concluded that charcoal and sulfur settled as soon as the compound was cast. The conclusion went hand-in-hand with the author-practitioner’s recommendation on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a> to cast black sulfured wax “little by little” (<em>petit a petit</em>) so as to prevent the charcoal from settling.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_051_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDZDVNakEtOXpjSVU.jpg" alt="fig. 13"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwJi-u8sfkVDZDVNakEtOXpjSVU"><span class="underline">Fig. 13</span></a>.

<p><span dir="ltr">Of the author-practitioner’s statements about black sulfured wax that we assessed, we could confirm only a few as explained above. Our black sulfured wax behaved differently from other descriptions on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a>. For example, cast black sulfured wax was not “very soft &amp; amiable &amp; pliant as copper;” it was much harder and more brittle than the cast pieces in the two comparative materials. Likewise, our melting attempts contradicted the author-practitioner’s explanation that black sulfured wax would “by means of sulfur, melts with very little heat, and exits without leaving any filth” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a>).</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Our preparation, applications, and evaluation of black sulfured wax left us with more questions than answers. Two observations defied our expectations: the compound did not register minute details of the mold when cast, and it was not easy to manipulate at room temperature. Given that the author-practitioner recommends black sulfured wax for casting and modeling, it was surprising that our compound did not perform these primary functions. The structure of our experiments may have contributed to these results. Our preparation procedure kept all ingredients at the lowest possible temperature, perhaps causing the compound to solidify too quickly. It is also possible that, despite the apparent scalability of the author-practitioner’s ratio, there is a minimum amount required—perhaps as little as a large walnut-sized portion of sulfur and a full eared-porringer of wax—for a satisfactory result.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Further experiments will have to consider these factors. Using larger quantities of the ingredients and mixing them at a higher temperature will certainly prevent the compound from cooling and hardening as quickly. A more extensive analysis of black sulfured wax will require constructing and using a plaster mold, as the author-practitioner devotes the rest of fol <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a> to a discussion of this specific type of mold for casting black sulfured wax. The plaster mold will have to be large enough to test casting the compound “little by little” as the author-practitioner suggests. The experiment should also include filling the mold excessively to observe overflow and reheating the mold to test whether the molten compound flows out without leaving residue.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Despite the specificity of the author-practitioner’s instructions and descriptions—at least in comparison to other wax compounds—“black sulfured wax” as a term seldom reappears in the rest of the manuscript. The lack of textual recurrence, however, may be misleading. Consider the entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150v/f/150v/tl"><span class="underline">150v</span></a>, “Molding hollow,” which includes the only other reference to black sulfured wax by its full name apart from fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/139v/f/139v/tl"><span class="underline">139v</span></a>. Halfway through the entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/150v/f/150v/tl"><span class="underline">150v</span></a> (where it continues onto fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/151r/f/151r/tl"><span class="underline">151r</span></a>), the author-practitioner mentions the compound while discussing the behaviors of white wax and charcoal. That he does so is significant, because he uses the term “wax” alone elsewhere in the entry. Read <em>in toto</em>, the entry refers to only one type of wax, which lines the inside of a mold and will eventually be melted out. In other words, “wax” and “black sulfured wax” are interchangeable, and the author invokes the latter term only to address its specific ingredients.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Equally notable is the entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/169v/f/169v/tl"><span class="underline">169v</span></a>, “Reducing a round figure to a hollow form.” The author-practitioner refers to “black wax mixed with sulfur, as is said.” Even though he does not use the term “black sulfured wax,” the expression “as is said” (<em>comme dict</em>) allows us to conclude that he is in fact referring to the earlier-discussed black sulfured wax. Here again, the reference to the compound is used interchangeably with “wax,” which in this entry is used for imprinting on a relief surface.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Although these are only two instances among the 108 entries and marginal notes that mention wax in the manuscript, they open up the possibility that the term “wax” without any qualifier may still refer to something other than a singular substance. Given the frequent mentions of casting or modeling with wax in the manuscript, many entries may in fact use the term to refer to black sulfured wax or to other wax compounds. While it would be impossible to determine the exact number of such cases, we may conclude that “wax” potentially has multiple referents. The author-practitioner’s use of the term as a shorthand expresses the material’s receptivity to further experimentation. The use of the term also demonstrates his understanding of wax as a fundamental material with inherent physical properties—of malleability, melting point, speed of use, and receptivity to color and mixture with other materials—that can be harnessed, manipulated, or augmented in compounds.</span></p>

The museum, however, has not conducted a scientific analysis of the model, and the exact composition of the black wax remains unknown. I would like to thank Christina Nielson for bringing the model to my attention.</span><a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">We may invoke Georges Didi-Huberman’s characterization of wax as “the unstable material par excellence” here, in the sense that the idea of black wax cannot be fixed to a specific number of variations. Georges Didi-Huberman, “Wax Flesh, Vicious Circles,” in <em>Encyclopaedia Anatomica: A Complete Collection of Anatomical Waxes</em> (Cologne: Taschen, 1999), 64. In another essay, he explores the metamorphic and polymorphic potential of wax in terms of “viscosity,” which in French (<em>viscosité</em>) has a stronger negative connotation of repulsion and repulsiveness. Thus he describes wax as a material that constantly defies linguistic as well as physical attempts to contain it.

Roberta Panzanelli (Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2008), 154–70.</span><a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
