<p><span dir="ltr">At least nine entries in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 pertain specifically to the process of casting flowers and plants.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Among these, three are devoted exclusively to the steps taken to cast a rose. This technique is a contemporary practice of making “life casts” of flowers, and there are clear precedents in the artistic production of Bernard Palissy and Wenzel Jamnitzer. As this essay will show, the motives for singling out roses to be molded is likely related to the literary production of sixteenth-century France. In particular, the casting of flowers suggests a connection between the manuscript author and a literary society in Toulouse known in the sixteenth century as the College de l’Art et Science de Rhétorique. This society awarded cast metal flowers as prizes for an annual poetry contest known as the Jeux Floraux, which originated in the city in the fourteenth century. The manuscript author-practitioner could possibly have had ties to the College, as a number of poems presented there in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries include references to alchemy and other natural subjects.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> The lengthiest entry in Ms. Fr. 640 on the molding of roses appears on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><span class="underline">155r</span></a>. The entry calls for the different parts of the rose to be cast separately: the branches, rosebud and the stem, advice not given elsewhere in the manuscript in regard to other cast flowers (such as a marigold).</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The author notes the possibility of molding the rose petals together by separating them with thread, indicating the particular care devoted to ensuring a detailed cast of the petals without allowing them to be crushed. To help strengthen the rose, the author calls for coating the outer petals with butter. An earlier entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129r/f/129r/tl"><span class="underline">129r</span></a>, “Molded Roses,” explicitly calls for the use of wheat oil to help stiffen rose petals (<em>les feuilles</em>).</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Evidently in the course of writing the manuscript, the author-practitioner discovered a problem with this technique, or simply changed his mind. In “Reinforcing flowers and delicate things” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/154v/f/154v/tl"><span class="underline">154v</span></a>, the author explains that wheat oil should <em>not</em> be used to strengthen flowers, but rather that melted butter should coat the <em>backs</em> of flower petals (as in the case of roses and pansies). This difference may offer a clue to the temporally linear process of the manuscript’s composition, as this example signals a clear difference in the processes used at a later point in the manuscript. The author may be self-correcting.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">To help metal flow between the leaves, the author notes later in the entry on fol. 155r that they should be joined “leaf to leaf” with “small veins of wax,” or sprues. The word “<em>foeuille</em>” refers to leaves here because the sketch in the left margin illustrates the larger spruing system in place that would have connected the rose leaves to one another and to the rose buds, which are surprisingly <em>not</em> shown detached from the stem (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>). It may be that this illustration accounts for a marginal note further below, which states that one can mold the rosebud near a piece of its stem, which is to be connected later to a separate “tinned latten” stem.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_003_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDbzAyS3hub05ydjA.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 1. Detail of rose drawing. Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 155r. Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. The spruing system connects the leaves and rosebud. The drawing also indicates the need to separate the branches from the stem of the rose. Source: gallica.bnf.fr.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">The latter half of the entry is largely given over to the process of cleaning the mold of ashes after the rose has been burned out and the wax infrastructure melted out, before the metal is cast into the mold. The author-practitioner’s comment that “this is the easiest way, but you can also do the other,” may have signaled to the reader to return to the entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117v/f/117v/tl"><span class="underline">117v</span></a>, “For making the ashes of flowers and plants leave molds.” As flowers and other objects burned in molds could leave ashes and charcoal in the mold, this step was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The rose produced by the process on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><span class="underline">155r</span></a> was meant to be altered further, as other entries in the manuscript reveal. The entry “Rose” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><span class="underline">155v</span></a> is a clear rejoinder to the preceding one as it contains instructions without which the rose molding on fol. 155r would have been incomplete. It begins by stating that because of the billowy nature of the rose bloom and the various arrangements of its petals, “it does not appear beautiful if it is not painted.” For emphasis, this fact is stated again later in the same entry. While the author does not explicitly describe the process for painting the rose here, the manuscript contains instructions for painting metal casts of other flowers (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/158v/f/158v/tl"><span class="underline">158v</span></a>) and of a crayfish (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/141v/f/141v/tl"><span class="underline">141v</span></a>). Fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/116r/f/116r/tl"><span class="underline">116r</span></a> of the manuscript also contains an entry for enameling fine leaves of a rose cast in gold (although the entry on fol. 155v speaks specifically of making the rose in tin and lead—not gold. The entry on fol. 155v also offers suggestions for how to correct imperfections in the cast, as well as how to glue or pin various pieces back together. Painting may not have been the only means of further amending the cast rose. On the next folio in the manuscript, <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156v/f/156v/tl"><span class="underline">156v</span></a>, the author gives instructions for molding a fly, which he affixes to a bouquet of sage. The proximity of this entry to that on fol. 155r is significant, as the process of molding the delicate rose petals seems linked to the molding of the fly’s wings, which are thin, necessitate separate casting, and are later soldered back onto the body of the fly.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> Equally significant to what is contained in the rose entries is what is left out: detailed discussion of the actual process of casting. Only in the margin of fol. 155r does the author add that the rose should be wetted with eau-de-vie to ensure a clean cast. One should understand the entry on fol. 155r as an elaboration on a process that had been more fully described elsewhere in the manuscript. For example, fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/117r/f/117r/tl"><span class="underline">117r</span></a> contains the entry “A means of molding flowers and plants,” which outlines how to arrange a flower or plant on the clay slab in order to keep the flower from being crushed by the plaster, or floating up as the wet plaster is poured into the clay form that holds the plant. This information is not included in the entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl"><span class="underline">155r</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> Surviving sixteenth-century objects made through the processes of life molding and casting exist from the workshops of Bernard Palissy and Wenzel Jamnitzer.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The bouquet of flowers atop Jamnitzer’s table ornament of 1549 (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) reflects one potential arrangement of such objects in a particularly masterful object (</span><span dir="ltr"><i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>). Separately cast plants of exceptional delicacy attributed to Jamnitzer also survive (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>). It seems more likely that the author of Ms. Fr. 640 was aware of Bernard Palissy, as on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><span class="underline">1r</span></a>, Bernard Palissy is listed <strong>(</strong><i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i><strong>)</strong>, as “M{estr}e Bernard palissi inventeur des rustiques figulines du roy et de la royne mere,”</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">with a cross marked to the left of Palissy’s name. This is close to the designation given to Palissy on the title page of his book <em>Discours admirables, de la nature des eaux et fontaines, tant naturelles qu'artificielles, des metaux, des sels et salines, des pierres, des terres, du feu et des maux</em> (Paris, 1580) (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner may have known (or heard) of Palissy’s text, which makes several references to the properties of roses, such as their ephemerality.</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">One cannot know whether the manuscript author-practitioner had direct knowledge of objects produced by Palissy, but his entries on roses deserve comparison with the <em>Rustic Ewer Decorated with Roses</em> (Musée du Louvre, Paris) attributed to Palissy or a close follower (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Made of faience, the ewer includes roses molded from life, the petals of which have evidently been crushed in the process.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_003_fa_14/1LSkhmWz6z66m2oZzJ9knHcU51iDIFTRg.jpg" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 2.

<p><span dir="ltr">The entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><span class="underline">155v</span></a>, which begins with a call to paint the rose in order to make it appear beautiful indicates an attunement to the aesthetic properties of roses. This association of roses and beauty was perhaps connected to the lyric poetry produced in France in the sixteenth century, in which flowers were often used as a central motif. The poems of Pierre de Ronsard (1524–85) and Jean de la Taille (1540–1608), for example, gained immense popularity in France and frequently referred specifically to flowers. Consider, for example, the following poem by Ronsard, published in 1553 with the collection <em>Les amours</em>:</span></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">My pet, come see, this eventide,</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">If that fair rose that opened wide</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">Its crimson robe, at dawn, unto</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">The sun, sees not already flown</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">Its crimsoned folds, and, like your own,</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">Its blush of morning’s tender hue.</span></em></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">Ah me, my pet! Alas, see what</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">A little time will do! In but</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">A trice, its beauty wilts, undone.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">Stepmother nature! Wicked, she,</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">If such a flower — ah me! ah me! —</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">lasts but from morn to setting sun.</span></em></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">Thus, if you heed my word, my pet,</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">Whilst childhood blooms and blossoms yet,</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">Green, fresh and new is the hour:</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">Before it fades, pluck, pluck your youth,</span></em></p>
<p><em><span dir="ltr">Lest, all too soon, old age, forsooth,</span></em></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"><em>Wither your beauty, like the flower</em>.</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Flowers and their blossoming had long been associated with youth and beauty in lyric poetry, a metaphor also explored by Francesco Petrarca in his <em>Rerum Vulgarium Fragmenta.</em> Within the context of Ronsard’s writings, the rose takes an especially central role as a trope through which to praise his beloved’s appearance while warning her of its transience. As Ronsard expresses in the final verse of the second stanza of the ode, the rose—like physical beauty—is subject to the ravages of time and “lasts but from morn to setting sun” (v.12).</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">One must consider that the same individuals who read poetry by Ronsard may also have been consumers of life-cast objects. In the context of the rose discussed by the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640, such an object would have inspired conversation about the transience of life. One of the goals of a life cast was to render everlasting an object whose beauty was in equal measure heightened and doomed by its impermanence. Furthermore, the poem calls to mind important questions of imitation. Ronsard’s poetry is concerned with broader models of poetic imitation in the Renaissance, which has been explored in depth by scholars including Thomas Greene and, more recently, JoAnn DellaNeva.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Greene identifies a certain randomness to the borrowings within Ronsard’s poetry, discussing sources ranging from Petrarca to Hesiod. DellaNeva, by comparison, explores an even more wide-ranging set of Italian poetic sources that informed Ronsard’s verse. What is important to stress is that one’s capacity to imitate and adhere closely to Petrarchan formulae was highly prized in sixteenth-century lyric production. It is worth drawing a parallel, therefore, between poetic imitation that would have been clear to readers of Ronsard’s poem and the imitation of nature that was central to the products of life casting. Like the poems, life casts were prized for their ability to imitate their natural counterparts. With the subject of the rose to link these two objects of artistic creation, one could certainly imagine Renaissance individuals discussing these links between poetry and sculpture when standing before a life-cast rose.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The practice of casting flowers in metal and poetic discourse around flowers were directly united in the activities of a major literary society in Toulouse, known in the sixteenth century as the College de l’Art et Science de Rhétorique. Since 1513 at the latest, the College took responsibility for organizing the Jeux Floraux, an annual competition first held in Toulouse in May of 1324 to honor achievement in lyric poetry.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Since its inception, the Jeux Floraux offered winners prizes of metal flowers. Initially only one flower, a golden violet, was offered as a prize, but soon after two other flowers—a wild rose (<em>églantine</em>) and a marigold—were also awarded to competition winners.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The exact casting techniques used for these flowers are not known, but among the earliest surviving flowers associated with the Jeux Floraux are those attached to a fourteenth-century marble sculpture repurposed to represent Clémence Isaure, an invented donor who in 1540 was said to have left a bequest to the College for the Jeux Floraux (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>,</span> <span dir="ltr"><i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In 1557 the sculpture was placed in the Hôtel d’Assézat in Toulouse, where the Jeux Floraux are still held annually to this day.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_003_fa_14/1a9fxXM3HtdhZXsBqpbGqY2TkV45XzPJY.jpg" alt="fig. 7"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 7.

<p><span dir="ltr">The production of such metal flowers suggests that artisans in Toulouse had honed particular skills surrounding this type of sculpture, although this is not to say that the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 was involved in making these objects for the Jeux Floraux.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It does confirm the existence of a well-educated audience that esteemed both the finery of metal flowers and the treatment of this motif in poetry. Pierre de Ronsard, whose lyric poem of 1553 was cited above, received a special honor as part of the Jeux Floraux in 1558.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While there is no proof that the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 was himself engaged in poetic production, he may have benefitted from contact with individuals involved in the College. A number of poems presented there in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries show an interest in alchemy, astrology, and natural philosophy, as François de Gélis and John Dawson have both observed in their studies of the manuscript documenting the College’s activities.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Several such poetic verses cited by Dawson seem potentially relevant to the activities of the author of Ms. Fr. 640.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">For example, the verses “Je suis grande alchimiste et qui de la nature/ Recherche curieux les plus rares secretz” (I am a great alchemist and I seek with care the rarest secrets of nature) from a poem of 1591 show an interest in the transformations and secrets of nature. Other verses reference alchemical and astrological ideas explicitly, while others are overtly Aristotelian, such as “La matière aspirant à la forme parfaicte” (the material aspires to the perfect form). If one follows de Gélis and Dawson’s suggestions that the Jeux Floraux could foster discourse on these topics, it seems possible that the College established a shared space in Toulouse for individuals interested in these matters. The objectives of the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. are highly practical and rooted primarily in practical processes of making, and thus distant from texts of alchemy and natural philosophy, however, the College may nonetheless have provided a social and intellectual network that nourished the interests of the author-practitioner in material transformation and nature’s secrets.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>

<li id="fn12" role="doc-endnote"><p> <span dir="ltr">The history of the Jeux Floraux and the shifting institutions surrounding its administration is too complex to be described here. While the exact date in which the Collège de Rhétorique administered the Jeux Floraux is uncertain, it seems likely that this body took control of the games between 1498 and 1513, in coincidence with the dating of a manuscript known as the <em>Livre Rouge</em>, which is separated in two volumes and contains records of the College’s activities. The organizations running the Jeux Floraux had been the Gaya Sciensa (also called the <em>Gay Saber</em>) from 1324 until the late fifteenth century, the Collège de l’Art et Science de Rhétorique until 1694, and the Académie des Jeux Floraux from 1694 onwards. The history of the Jeux Floraux from its inception through the seventeenth century is presented in John Charles Dawson, <em>Toulouse in the Renaissance. The Floral Games; University and Student Life; Etienne Dolet (1532–1534)</em> (New York: AMS Press, Inc., 1966); François de Gélis, <em>Histoire critique des Jeux Floraux depuis leur origine jusqu’à leur transformation en académie (1323–1694)</em> (Geneva and Paris: Slatkine, 1981). On the history of the Jeux Floraux after its governing body was officially reorganized as an academy, see Axel Duboul, <em>Les deux siècles de l’Académie des Jeux Floraux</em>, (Toulouse: Edouard Privat, 1901), 2 vols.</span><a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn14" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">On Clémence Isaure, see Pierre-Louis Boyer, <em>Clémence Isaure. Vérités sur une chimère toulousaine</em> (Paris: Atlantica, 2010). While the addition of these particular flowers to the sculptures has not been precisely dated, it seems likely that they were added by 1581, by which time a bronze plaque identifying the figure as Clémence Isaure was placed on the statue’s pedestal. The presence of the flowers is also recorded in eighteenth-century prints showing the statue.
