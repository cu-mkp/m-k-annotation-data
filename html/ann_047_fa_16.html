<p><span dir="ltr">The “Spinet playing by itself” entry appears amid a cluster of assorted topics. Those immediately preceding the “Spinet” entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><span class="underline">104v</span></a> provide information about treating dogs’ mange, casting in wax, and decorating garments with silver, while entries on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/105r/f/105r/tl"><span class="underline">105r</span></a> attend to the physical appearances of turtles, the behaviors of pigments and paints, and grafting trees.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The spinet is a small, early modern keyboard instrument similar to the harpsichord that operates by the plucking of its strings, as opposed to the hammering mechanism of the modern piano. The author-practitioner’s brief description of an automatic version of this musical instrument stands out as a somewhat odd insertion in the overall manuscript. Mentions of the spinet feature in just two of the manuscript’s entries,</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">and references to clockwork technologies and mechanics are also relatively infrequent in Ms. Fr. 640.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This slight coverage might imply the author-practitioner’s limited expertise in these areas. His designation of this musical machine as an “invention” connotes a sense of novelty and originality, at least to a modern reader. Moreover, its designation as “your” invention raises the additional question: who is the inventor? This essay considers the possible reasons underlying the author-practitioner’s inclusion of the “Spinet” entry by assessing it within the internal context of the manuscript itself. Accordingly, this study sets fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><span class="underline">104v</span></a> against the wider background of music, automata, and “invention” in sixteenth-century Europe, and it experiments with the reconstruction of this self-playing spinet based on the entry’s text and accompanying image. The result suggests that the “Spinet” entry does not likely reflect extensive first-hand practice but rather arose from the author-practitioner’s encounters and interests.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="context"><span dir="ltr">Context</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">In the margin to the left of the text of “Spinet playing by itself” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><span class="underline">104v</span></a>, the author-practitioner offers a simple sketch of the mechanism he envisions for this “invention” (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>). The illustration depicts a horizontal rod or dowel encircled by a series of disc-like objects placed at more or less regular intervals. Each disc or “wheel” is unique: the one placed second to the left actually resembles something more akin to a ring, while the one furthest to the right merely comprises two perfunctory quill strokes that, when viewed on their own, do not necessarily give the impression of a circular or disc-like form. Compared to the precise visual schematic one would expect from a modern instruction manual, the author-practitioner’s illustration appears incomplete, inconsistent, and hastily drawn.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_047_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDZGVXRnV1UkpFek0.png" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 1. Spinet mechanism. Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 104v. Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. Source: gallica.bnf.fr.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">The text of the recipe is similarly sketchy in nature, especially in comparison with many of the more detailed entries contained in the manuscript. Besides the mention of “quills,” no other materials are specified, no measurements are outlined, and no tools are suggested. Furthermore, the author-practitioner omits any information about his particular understanding of the spinet, an instrument subject to a number of crucial variables, such as the shape and size of the case and the spacing of the strings. The brief mention of the cittern, a small quill-plucked instrument related to the lute, verifies that he envisioned a plucking mechanism for his spinet contraption, but he neglects to elaborate on this mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">When examined in isolation, however, the opacity of the “Spinet playing by itself” entry belies the author-practitioner’s familiarity with contemporary musical instruments evident in the manuscript as a whole. Specifically, plucked-stringed instruments and their material components feature as tools, both literal and heuristic, in various places in Ms. Fr. 640. Four entries explain how harpsichord and spinet strings can be used to arrange and position animal specimens for casting.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner also invokes in a handful of entries the shape of the mandore or mandora, a gut-strung and quill-plucked instrument also belonging to the cittern/lute family, as a shape to emulate when forming clay slabs.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The mandore body’s “long shape” that he describes on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/114v/f/114v/tl"><span class="underline">114v</span></a> can be observed in early modern pictorial representations of the instrument, such as that of the German composer and musician Michael Praetorius from 1619 (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>). Similarly, a reference on <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/113r/f/113r/tl"><span class="underline">113r</span></a> to harpsichord strings also calls upon the reader to create a “cake shaped like a mandore” of clay for casting purposes. In addition to employing musical materials and metaphors for nonmusical ends, the author-practitioner explicitly references instrument building in three entries: fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/98r/f/98r/tl"><span class="underline">98r</span></a> includes instructions for creating lute varnish, while fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tl"><span class="underline">4r</span></a> and <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><span class="underline">7r</span></a> reference the varnish and glue used in guitar making, respectively.</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_047_fa_16/12vMQwGBQmhKuhX3mHHm-wq8VPuE9cf0b.jpg" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 2.

<p><span dir="ltr">The collective presence in the manuscript of plucked-stringed instruments—spinets, harpsichords, the cittern, mandores, lutes, and guitars—mirrors the particular artisanal world of instrument builders in sixteenth-century France. The French construction of keyboard instruments during this time mostly focused on the production of spinets rather than their larger cousin, the harpsichord.</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">None of these French examples have survived, but based on extant illustrations, the majority of these instruments seem to have been constructed with a rectangular case, in contrast to the polygonal spinets frequently crafted elsewhere in Europe around the same time.</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">For example, one Venetian spinet dating from 1540 exhibits a pentagonal construction (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>), while an image published by the French music theorist Marin Mersenne in 1636 displays the rectangular shape evidently typical of French craftsmanship (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>). However, though spinet making appears to have coalesced around certain manufacturing conventions in sixteenth-century France, the builders of such spinets in fact participated in the construction of a wide ambit of plucked-stringed instruments. This is evidenced by inventories of the workshops of Parisian <em>épinettiers</em> compiled from the mid to late sixteenth century. One such inventory dating from 1556 lists spinets and clavichords as well as viols and a cittern, while that of another <em>épinettier</em> in 1587 registers more lutes, violins, mandores, and other plucked-stringed instruments than keyboard instruments.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_047_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDZjlFWHFacnBxejQ.jpg" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 3.

<p><span dir="ltr"> While the plucked-stringed instruments mentioned in the manuscript shared similar origins of production, the extent of their social distribution in sixteenth-century France is less clear, though it appears that most such instruments possessed links to elite and upper-middling culture.</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The lute, “the instrument neither of drinking peasants nor of shouting soldiers,” appears to have been most closely associated with both the hired and amateur musicians of the nobility and upper bourgeoisie.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The cittern, on the other hand, experienced periods of vogue among the French elite, but it seems that for the most part it was viewed as an instrument for commoners.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">French nobles of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries regularly employed spinet players to provide courtly entertainment, and Diane de Poitiers, consort of Henry II, played the lute and reportedly never traveled without her spinet.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">But it is likely that French spinets also featured in more middling households. In the Flemish context at least, it appears that spinets may have been increasingly marketed to an “affluent … clientele of middle-class burghers” by the late sixteenth century.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Although no exemplars survive today, records indicating a thriving French spinet industry suggest that the spinet was also a “normal musical instrument in bourgeois households” in sixteenth-century France.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The “Spinet playing by itself” entry also reflects a lively interest in automatic instruments and automata more generally in the early modern period, though the exact nature of the author-practitioner’s personal familiarity with automata is difficult to determine. During the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the Catholic Church commissioned self-moving mechanical figures and objects to adorn the clocks and organs of cathedrals, and automata similarly featured on municipal town clocks in various European cities.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">However, elite society and the spectacle of court culture provided an especially powerful impetus for the creation of these objects of mechanical wonder.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">By the late sixteenth century, hydraulic-powered automata had become common features on aristocratic estates throughout much of Europe. The French essayist Michel de Montaigne encountered dancing mechanical statues and an automatic organ during his tours of noble gardens from 1580 to 1581.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">European nobles were often presented with toy automata as gifts, and mechanical animals frequently attended the tables of lavishly-staged royal feasts.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Indeed, during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, builders of automata began to appeal to a specifically “noble” form of curiosity in order to salvage their practice from its earlier associations with deceitful magic and the lowly mechanical arts.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Textual sources concerning automata also circulated during this time. For example, it appears that a handful of printed and manuscript versions of Hero of Alexandria’s <em>Pneumatica</em>, a frequently-read work on automata in the Renaissance, made their way to France in the late sixteenth century, though the extent of their dissemination seems to have been limited.</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While it is difficult to ascertain the precise nature of the author-practitioner’s encounters with automata, the references on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><span class="underline">104v</span></a> to a clockwork mechanism and a rotating axle “programmed” with protruding pins (in this case, feather quills) certainly bear some resemblance to contemporary mechanical-musical technologies. In the late fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci produced a series of detailed plans for his famously complicated <em>viola organista</em>, a type of keyboard instrument that adapted technological elements from the hurdy-gurdy. The hurdy-gurdy, or <em>vielle</em>, is operated by cranking a metal shaft that rotates a rosined wooden wheel to vibrate a set of strings with friction (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>). Often considered the instrument of beggars, the hurdy-gurdy was common in sixteenth-century France and may have helped inspire the rotating axle-wheel mechanism described by the author-practitioner.</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Later examples of automatic instruments share common technical features with the author-practitioner’s “spinet” as well. Under the employ of Frederick V to design a pleasure garden in Heidelberg, the Huguenot landscape designer and engineer Salomon de Caus produced a work entitled <em>Les raisons des forces mouvantes</em> in 1615, which included detailed descriptions and diagrams for various automata, including a water-powered organ operating with a programmed barrel (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Writing in 1636, Mersenne attributed the invention of the pinned-barrel mechanism (or at least its application to keyboard instruments) to the “ingenious” Germans, who miraculously used it “to perform many pieces of music on the spinet without using the hand.”</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Contrary to such claims, the pinned-barrel mechanism had in fact been used in automata for centuries by the 1600s.</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Mersenne was nevertheless probably referring to the Bidermann and Langenbucher families of Augsburg, who produced a number of automatic spinets in the early seventeenth century. Unlike the axle-wheel-quill construction described by the author-practitioner, the Bidermann/Langenbucher spinets use solid, continuous cylinders of wood studded with metal pins that act upon the normal internal workings of a spinet. However, similar to the author-practitioner’s description, they do employ clock technologies such as gears and springs to power them (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_047_fa_16/1AurqgGG-I0DS94aawpfK4owIPWloao4d.jpg" alt="fig. 5"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 5.

<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner deemed a “spinet playing by itself” worthy of being labeled an “invention” in spite of its evident affinities with musical automata of the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries. Contemporaneous writings reveal a wider early modern preoccupation with the idea of “invention.” The French ceramicist Bernard Palissy appears in a list of books and authors on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/1r/f/1r/tl"><span class="underline">1r</span></a> in the manuscript, as “inventor of rustic figurines,” a designation which was featured on the title page of his <em>Discours admirables</em> published in 1580. The list of books in Ms. Fr. 640 also references a late sixteenth-century commercial handbook of <em>nova inventione</em> from Italy (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2v/f/2v/tl"><span class="underline">2v</span></a>) as well as a work entitled <em>Nouvelles inventions pour bien bastir et à petits fraiz</em> by the French architect Philibert de l’Orme (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/170v/f/170v/tl"><span class="underline">170v</span></a>).</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The meaning of “invention” in the early modern period, however, was more elastic and capacious than what is connoted by the modern concepts of “individual genius” and “innovation.” It is true that the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had already witnessed the coupling of invention with notions of individual authorship and innovation, which provided conceptual foundations for the development of intellectual property and patent systems.</span><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">However, these associations, and the idea of invention as technological novelty more specifically, only gradually rose to prominence during the seventeenth century. Thus, in centuries prior, “invention” carried a greater variety of cultural significations.</span><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The Italian scholar Polydore Vergil (ca. 1470–1555), who is included in the list of books on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/2r/f/2r/tl"><span class="underline">2r</span></a>, demonstrated this fluid notion of invention in his <em>De inventoribus rerum</em>. Rather than compiling the technological innovations of his time, this work instead concerned itself with pinpointing the origins of traditions and inventions among the ancients, especially the founding of religious customs and sects. Polydore used the Latin verb <em>invenire</em> in a flexible manner, meaning both to create or devise but also to find or literally “come upon” something already in existence.</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Thus, when discussing the Greek origins of musical instruments, for example, he relates Pliny’s opinion that Mercury had “invented” piped wind instruments, while Amphion was the “discoverer” of the lyre.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Such multivalent formulations of the idea of invention were widespread. In the realm of sixteenth-century poetry and rhetoric, French writers often portrayed literary invention both as an act of “finding” as well as one of selective arranging and creating out of already extant literary material.</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Even as late as the early seventeenth century, Dutch thinkers frequently viewed the practices of imitation and invention as inextricably linked within a continuous process, and individuals characterized as “inventors” often preoccupied themselves with the recovery of “lost” knowledge and the inventions of antiquity as much as producing new creations of their own.</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Accordingly, the author-practitioner marshals the concept of invention in a diverse manner in the manuscript, raising questions concerning how one should interpret his choice to apply this label to his description of the automatic spinet. On the one hand, in a section entitled “For the workshop” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><span class="underline">166r</span></a>, the author-practitioner questions the very idea of novel invention.</span><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Responding to “jealous” artisans who may take issue with the appropriation of their knowledge, the author-practitioner exhorts his readers to dispel the notion that they “are able to invent anything new,” and to recognize instead that one must strive to “rediscover” that which was already known in antiquity, thereby reflecting the humanistic ethos of his time. On the other hand, elsewhere in the manuscript, he readily claims ownership over his “own invention” of the use of grains of yellow millet, amaranth, or rapeseed as replacement eyes in the molding of animals (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/144r/f/144r/tl"><span class="underline">144r</span></a>, “Turtles,” and marginal note). Most often, however, the instances of “invention” in the manuscript variably refer to the generation or discovery of technologies, techniques, and material usages by other craftsmen rather than the author-practitioner himself. Fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21r/f/21r/tl"><span class="underline">21r</span></a> (“For firing a cannon at night”) and a marginal note on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><span class="underline">17r</span></a> mention technological innovations that “others” have developed for operating cannons. The “Glassworker” entries on fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><span class="underline">37v</span></a> and <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/32v/f/32v/tl"><span class="underline">32v</span></a> respectively describe the practices of “those who discovered the invention of working in small works of soft enamels” and glassworkers’ apparent lack of the “invention” a “perfect red.” A marginal note on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120r/f/120r/tl"><span class="underline">120r</span></a> relates of the “invention of <em>crocum</em>,” or <em>crocum ferri</em>, a material which facilitates the casting of flowers in gold in addition to silver, that “it has not been forty years that one knows this in Germany.” Citing Herodotus, the author-practitioner even discusses who should be given credit for the invention of deep-sea navigation on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><span class="underline">162r</span></a>. No indication is given as to the provenance of the “beautiful invention” of grinding stone alum for use as a binding agent in sand (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/108v/f/108v/tl"><span class="underline">108v</span></a>, marginal note). Thus, given this term’s varied treatment in the manuscript, the status of the “spinet playing by itself” as an “invention” remains open to question. The author-practitioner may have viewed this musical machine as something uniquely novel and original, or perhaps as an innovation or discovery in a more general, collective sense.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<h2 id="reconstruction"><span dir="ltr">Reconstruction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Given the ambiguity of the entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><span class="underline">104v</span></a>, any attempt at reconstructing the “spinet playing by itself” should necessarily be treated with caution. Thus, the following efforts should not be viewed as an attempt at authentic reconstruction but rather as a practical investigation into the author-practitioner’s possible mindset when he jotted down his instructions. Among the questions that this practical investigation set out to answer were: 1) what kinds of knowledge, skill, and experience would one need to actually construct something along the lines of the author-practitioner’s description, and 2) how does the answer to the first question affect our reading of the “Spinet playing by itself” entry? What follows is a selective account of the reconstruction process, focusing on central issues that arose in this undertaking and general observations regarding procedure.</span><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The task of reconstruction demanded various efforts to fill in the information gaps of the entry and the author-practitioner’s diagram. For simplicity’s sake, I decided to approximate a reconstruction using a scaled-down model. This involved creating a simple stringed instrument upon which the rotating axle implement would operate. I opted for three strings spaced one inch from one another set over a flat wooden baseboard, even though an actual spinet would contain many more strings placed very close to one another (see, again, Figs. 3 and 4). This decision to further sacrifice authenticity stemmed from my intuition that fewer strings and wide spaces between them would save time in construction and offer better chances of producing a functioning mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Regarding materials, I had to make a number of informed if ultimately rather arbitrary decisions. Wood is one common denominator between the musical instruments referenced in the manuscript, and it is easily manipulated and “pierced” per the recipe’s instructions. A keyword search for “wood” in the English translation of the manuscript yields a large number of results, and one entry (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/34v/f/34v/tl"><span class="underline">34v</span></a>) even describes using a banded boxwood vessel that would presumably be crafted in a similar way to the “wheels” described in the spinet recipe. For these reasons, I decided to use wood for the axle and wheels, and specifically poplar and pine due to their availability. Regarding strings for the instrument, harpsichord and spinet strings were historically crafted from iron or brass, and thus I determined that modern steel guitar strings would function as a suitable, cheap substitute.</span><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Concerning the quills, crow quills were the norm in plucked-stringed keyboard instruments before the modern development of plastic plectra. However, crow quills vary by consistency and are more prone to breaking than plastic, and the handling and cutting of them for use in a keyboard instrument is a developed skill in its own right.</span><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Therefore, I decided first to experiment with fashioning my own plectra from rigid plastic (I used guitar picks) and to move on to quills if time allowed (which it did not). Finally, I imagined that some sort of adhesive material would be needed to “attach” the quills to the wooden wheels. Various types of glues feature throughout the manuscript, so I decided to start with modern wood glue and proceed to investigate more historically faithful types if time permitted (which, again, it did not). Likewise, in the interest of time, this reconstruction relied on modern power tools in addition to hand tools.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In planning, I considered a number of possible configurations that could be interpreted from the author-practitioner’s words. The references to feathers/quills and the cittern make it reasonably clear that the author-practitioner envisioned the axle-wheels rotating over a spinet’s soundboard, enabling the quills to pluck the strings. The recipe vaguely states that the wheels should be pierced around their edges (<em>espesseur</em>) implying that this is where the plectra should be placed. The only efficacious design I could conceive of would position the plectra on the perimeter of the wheels so that they would point outward from the rotating axle, similar to how builders arranged the pins on the programmed barrels used in contemporaneous automata. I further reasoned that the rotating axle implement would need to be placed at an angle in relation to the strings (i.e., neither parallel nor perpendicular to them) in order for it to operate. If it were positioned parallel to the strings, the various plectra would only be able to pluck one of the strings, which would surely be insufficient for the type of “song” imagined by the author-practitioner. Alternatively, if the axle-wheel implement were placed perpendicular to the strings, the plectra would not be able to pluck them at all.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Prior to working with the materials, I drew up a simple sketch (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>) of what I envisioned and composed a list of the components and their dimensions. Interestingly, however, the dimensions I first proposed ultimately shaped the final product (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 9</span></i> and <i><span class="underline">Vid. 1</span></i>) much less than I originally imagined they would. In fact, only one of my proposed dimensions ended up in the final construction, which was my initial, arbitrary decision to space the three strings one inch apart. The dimensions for the rest of the components, then, were largely determined by 1) in reference to the baseline dimension of one-inch spaces between the strings, 2) the nature of the available materials and tools, and 3) trial and error. To illustrate how these factors shaped my process, consider the following examples. In Columbia University’s MakerSpace workshop where the reconstruction work took place, there was an available plank available for use with suitable dimensions (14” x 14” x 3/4”) for a baseboard. Given that I had already decided the strings would be spaced at one-inch intervals, crafting wheels with a thickness of ¾ inch would thus afford sufficient room between them when placed on the dowel axle, and therefore another available plank with a thickness of ¾ inch seemed appropriate for fashioning the wheels. I cut the wheels with a circular drill attachment, choosing a size roughly 2 inches in diameter. Next, I drilled holes measuring ½ inch in diameter in the center of the wheels for the dowel axle to pass through. However, due to my lack of experience with a drill press, I unfortunately drilled the holes off center. To remedy this, I filed and sanded the wheels until they were all roughly of the same size and the drilled holes were centered.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_047_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDUl94WWEwNTJhSFU.jpg" alt="fig. 8"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 8.

<p><span dir="ltr">Indeed, measurement by visual reference rather than by numerical metric proved indispensable in constructing the automatic spinet model. Almost invariably, gauging the dimensions of the components by comparing and marking them in relation to each other rather than taking a ruler to each and every piece offered both greater speed and accuracy. This approach may well be common knowledge among woodworkers and other craftspeople dealing in the precise construction of interlocking parts, but it is a method I only came upon through engaging with materials. As just one example of my reliance on this method of referential measurement, take the case of determining the required lengths of the plastic plectra. Having ascertained that using a straight edge to measure the distance between the string height and the curved surface of the bottom of the wheels would be difficult, I instead took a small wooden block with squared edges, positioned it on the baseboard flush with one of the taut strings and the flat edge of one of the wheels, and traced the outline of both the string and the edge of the wheel onto the block (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 10</span></i>). This gave me an accurate visual representation of the distance between the string height and the wheel. I marked this distance on a piece of paper, transferred it back to the block, and extended it with a straight edge squared against a flat surface. I could then easily use this marked block as a visual benchmark for marking and cutting the plastic plectra to their requisite lengths (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_047_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDeDdnb2VoZkR4Uzg.jpg" alt="fig. 10"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 10.

The distance between the strings and the wheels was marked on a sheet of paper and then transferred back to the wooden block using a straight edge, represented in this image by the space between the left edge of the block and the vertical line. This way, the appropriate length of the plectra could easily be determined visually.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">The process of reconstruction raised additional practical issues that I had not anticipated in the brainstorming and planning stages. For example, I had not foreseen the importance of ensuring that the incisions made on the perimeters of the wheels for the plectra were at the proper angle, namely directly toward the center of the wheel. I made a number of these incisions noticeably off-kilter, as one can observe by looking down the length of the axle and comparing the spacings of the tips of the plectra (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 12</span></i>). This spacing, of course, affects the time interval between “plucks” and thus the performance of the programmed song. Additionally, shortening the gap between the edge of the wheels and the strings, and in turn shortening the length of the plectra, would have achieved a more precise distribution of plectra tips. I also did not foresee that my dowel axle would float back and forth across the strings without some fixed piece on the dowel between the nail handle and the nearest end block (see <i><span class="underline">Fig. 9</span></i>). Thus, as currently built, one must ensure that the dowel is pushed completely into the block at the opposite end as one rotates it. Moreover, the axle and end blocks being made of untreated wood creates some friction and slippages when the apparatus rotates, which leads me to believe that treating the wood, or even better, using metal for the axle and end pieces, would provide smoother function. Finally, the use of two separate components—wheels and an axle—for the rotating implement proved to be slightly problematic. The fact that each wheel must be cut separately and arranged precisely along the axle produces occasion for error that could be avoided by using a continuous cylindrical object, which indeed appears to have been standard for contemporaneous automata.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_047_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDbkdneDhFSEY0N3M.jpg" alt="fig. 12"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 12.

<h2 id="conclusions"><span dir="ltr">Conclusions</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Despite the author-practitioner’s assurance that “your invention will be effected,” experimenting with reconstruction confirmed my suspicion that the effectiveness of the “spinet playing by itself” is in fact far from assured in practice. In my scaled-down version, I enjoyed numerous conveniences that helped me complete the project: I only dealt with three strings as opposed to the approximately thirty to fifty strings present on an early modern spinet; I spaced them far apart; I often relied upon modern tools and materials, which enabled swift construction, durability, and a high level of precision, and I used a spacious, blank baseboard upon which I could freely draw and test out different possibilities of construction. Even with these aids, numerous problems arose in the process of reconstruction, helping me to appreciate just how difficult it would be to create a full-blown version on the order of what the author-practitioner seems to be suggesting in fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/104v/f/104v/tl"><span class="underline">104v</span></a>. It became clear to me that such an intricate construction could only be carried out in a protracted process of trial and error by someone intensely knowledgeable about their craft. If the author-practitioner had in fact possessed this sort of extensive practical experience, it seems likely that the “spinet playing by itself” would have received more than just the few lines that it occupies in the manuscript.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While this same conclusion could well be extrapolated from the sheer brevity of the “Spinet” entry, my efforts at reconstruction caused me to reevaluate the evidentiary basis of such a position. In particular, while my modern sensibilities had initially considered the absence of any measurements in the recipe to be a critical omission exposing a lack of practical foundation or incomplete instructions, my hands-on investigation revealed that specific measurements are simply not amenable to creating the “spinet playing by itself.” Not only would narrating step-by-step instructions and dimensions in written form for this project be an arduous task, but because the procedure depends crucially on the baseline dimensions and form of the stringed instrument being used (i.e., the spinet), any such specific instructions would only be useful if spinets had standard dimensions and features in the sixteenth century, which of course they did not. Rather, such a project would rely upon relative and referential measurement, which, as I have explained, I resorted to somewhat instinctively.</span><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Nevertheless, despite the impractical nature of communicating precise instructions for the automatic spinet, I still find the absence of other traces of practice, such as any elaboration on materials, tools, or procedure, to be a persuasive indication that the author-practitioner probably did not see this project to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">To conclude, the presence of the “Spinet” entry in the manuscript is probably more a manifestation of the author-practitioner’s interests and encounters rather than a product of laborious practice. These interests took inspiration from a variety of contexts. The mentions of plucked-stringed instruments in the manuscript indicate that the author-practitioner had some basic familiarity with these objects. This familiarity could have resulted from encounters in an instrument builder’s workshop, but it may also suggest some connection to the elite and upper-bourgeois social worlds in which these instruments were used. Elite social contexts also cultivated a vogue for automata in the author-practitioner’s day. Additionally, the author-practitioner seems to have been interested in invention, an idea evolving in its connection to notions of innovation, discovery, and ownership at the time of the manuscript’s composition. Practical investigation confirms that he likely did not attempt to realize this “invention” himself, but it also cautions against treating the absence of detail in the manuscript as a clear-cut indication of the author-practitioner’s lack of practical experience. Finally, this study calls further attention to the various functions of the author-practitioner’s document, namely the ways in which it should sometimes be read as an instruction manual, while at other times it should be seen more as a compendium of observations or a catalog of thoughts-in-progress.</span></p>

The “Mathematical figures without ruler or compass” section on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19v/f/19v/tl"><span class="underline">19v</span></a> explains how one can produce a perfectly symmetrical figure by folding paper and using ink to “stamp” a drawing’s mirror image.</span><a href="#fnref37" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
