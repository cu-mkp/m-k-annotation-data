<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The author-practitioner makes frequent references to diverse kinds of glue and their applications in BnF Ms. Fr. 640. For example, there are entries on fish glue, as well as on such adhesives as mouth glue and starch glue,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and on such (as yet unidentified) glues as “colle de retailles,” “clear glue,” and “strong glue.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Glue is also a key element in plaster and other materials used in making objects of interest to the author-practitioner.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> His use of glue throughout the manuscript indicates that he understood this medium to be a very important tool, specifically, as an adhesive and as a surface conditioner in various recipes.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Interestingly, despite the common use of animal glues in artisanal work, the author-practitioner does not provide recipes for these kinds of adhesives. In fact, he only gives details for how to make fish glue, which is described on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><span class="underline">7r</span></a> in a recipe entitled “Fish glue or isinglass and mouth glue:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is made from codfish skin, boiled rather than being salted. Joiners glue their masterpieces with it and guitar makers use it for delicate works. It wants to be strongly beaten, then soaked gently in barely boiling water.</p>
<p>Mouth glue is made of parchment scrapings and one uses it without fire, for glueing paper or similar things, wetting it with the mouth.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="pull-left"></span>Fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><span class="underline">7r</span></a> is analogous to another premodern fish glue recipe provided by Cennino Cennini (ca. 1370–ca. 1440), the Italian artist and author of <em>Il libro dell’arte</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a glue which is known as fish glue. This glue is made of various kinds of fish. If you put the little piece, or leaf, in your mouth, just as it is, until it gets a little wet, and rub it on sheep parchments or other parchments, this fastens them together very securely … It is good and excellent for mending lutes and other fine paper, wooden, or bone objects. When you put it on the fire, put in half a goblet of clear water for each leaf.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>While both of these recipes for fish glue have few specifics, they give the modern reader a general understanding of the production and artisanal use of fish glue in the premodern era.</p>
<p>Fish glue shares an important characteristic with other kinds of animal glue: it can be rendered back into a liquid form when heated, which does not affect its strength or durability upon cooling and solidifying.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> This quality makes it suitable for repairing wooden furniture and musical instruments, and both fish and animal glues continue to be used in artisanal workshops today, especially in those of luthiers. As a woodworker, I have used many kinds of glues—including industrial glues and natural hide glue—in making table tennis blades, various kinds of pens (e.g., fountain pens, dip pens, and pencils), and conductors’ batons. However, I have never used fish glue in my work. Thus, a reconstruction of the fish glue recipe on fol. 7r provides me with the opportunity to try out a new adhesive; I am especially interested to do so, as contemporary artisans recommend it highly in their own musical instrument- and furniture-making practices.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The focus of this essay is my analysis and reconstruction of the fish glue recipe on fol. 7r, in which I test the properties of this adhesive. I also examine a cluster of recipes on fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><span class="underline">155v</span></a>, <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156v/f/156v/tl"><span class="underline">156v</span></a>, and <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159r/f/159r/tl"><span class="underline">159r</span></a> of Ms. Fr. 640 that discuss fish glue. The first two entries deal with how to use this glue in different projects, and the third entry presents a descriptive passage about its properties.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-glue">What is Glue?</h2>
<p>Glue is generally obtained from boiling animal hides and hooves, or fish parts, into a gelatin that hardens into a cement upon drying.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The essential quality of a good glue is twofold: to create a secure bond between the parts that are being joined, and to act as a protective layer between a given material and the environment. For a sense of how contemporaries of the author-practitioner understood glue, we can look to Randle Cotgrave’s 1611 French-English Dictionary. Here, Cotgrave provides several entries under the term <em>colle</em> (glue), including two that are referenced in Ms. Fr. 640: <em>colle de bouche</em> (defined by Cotgrave as “mouth glue, water glue”), and <em>colle de poisson</em> (which Cotgrave also defines as “mouth glue, water glue”).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Fish glue is an organic adhesive made from boiling down the different parts of a fish, specifically the skin, air bladder, bones, or meat. It dries into a clear yellowish color, and it has been used worldwide in artisanal work from ancient Egypt to the present time as a binding medium for repairs in wood and in paper conservation.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The author-practitioner is clearly interested in fish glue, as we can see in his description on fol. 7r. Despite the brevity of this entry, the text contains a reasonable amount of detail regarding materials and process. For example, the author-practitioner prefers to use unsalted codfish skin; the skins need to be “beaten” and then simmered in “barely boiling water,” and he also indicates the length of time it takes to make the mixture in the accompanying marginal note: “One beats it and soaks it in white wine , then one melts it on a slow fire.” Interestingly, this note also references the use of white wine and “spirits” in the production process, a term we will encounter again on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159r/f/159r/tl"><span class="underline">159r</span></a>, as discussed below.</p>
<p>The author-practitioner views fish glue as an appropriate adhesive for joining the delicate parts of a cast metal rose and for using on the molded wings of a fly, on fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl"><span class="underline">155v</span></a> and <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/156v/f/156v/tl"><span class="underline">156v</span></a> respectively.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Here, he notes that the metal parts of the cast tin rose, “being thus thin,” are “is troublesome to solder, and may melt some of the leaves and also the cast flowers.” Accordingly, he suggests that “one does not take pains to solder, but one grafts the pieces to join them &amp; one glues them with fish glue that has been a little tempered &amp; thickly melted” (fol. 155v). This entry is interesting for the insight it provides into the author-practitioner’s material understanding of, and practical experience with, fish glue. The instructions about moistening glue given on fol. 155v recall details from fol. 7r about mouth glue, which “is made of parchment scrapings and one uses it without fire, for glueing paper or similar things, wetting it with the mouth.” Interestingly, Cennini also gives similar instructions for fish glue: “If you put the little piece, or leaf, in your mouth, just as it is, until it gets a little wet, and rub it on sheep parchments or other parchments, this fastens them together very securely.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The detailed instructions for gluing the wings to the body of the cast fly on fol. 156v further illuminates uses of fish glue in joining together delicate objects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If some flaw happens to the wings of your fly, beat some tin very thin, or some gold or silver, if you have cast it in it, &amp; trim with some scissors what one needs to reattach there, &amp; next, apply it with your small pincers &amp; glue it with fish glue, prepared as put below. And before, heat lightly your work, in order that its coldness does not refuse the glue, which will be soon dry, heating it from afar. Next, cover lightly the joints of the reattached thing with some modeling wax, which is white wax mixed with a lot of ceruse or lead white, melting it well with a hot iron point. You will also cut some small bits of spinet strings &amp; glue with the said glue, &amp; once dry, that is to say the feet, repair with this. You will thicken them with the same melted wax, to render them equal.</p>
<p>One could even cast it in gold &amp; silver, without the feet &amp; without applying it on a flower, by making the gate under the belly &amp; reattaching with solder the feet, &amp; if needs be the wings with the same metal, &amp; it could be enamelled by fortifying the wings a little &amp; the feet, as said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>Fols. 155v and 156v are essentially about molding fragile things, and together they demonstrate how the author-practitioner understands the medium of fish glue as a material that imparts strength to vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>A few pages later another entry about “Fish Glue” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/159r/f/159r/tl"><span class="underline">159r</span></a> gives a detailed account of the reactions of this adhesive to various materials and conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beat it very fine &amp; thin on a well-cleaned anvil, &amp; next wet it with eau-de-vie over hot ashes &amp; a low fire, &amp; it will be quickly melted; &amp; if it is not strong &amp; thick enough, add eau-de-vie. And take heed not to put it to melt in a fatty vessel, but in a new one, if you can. It is melted on the fire &amp; is also dried quickly on the fire, but it may be warmed from a distance once on the work. It holds strongly. With it one joins flowers &amp; delicate things of gold, of silver, of tin, &amp; other materials which are in danger of spoiling if soldered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>Here, the author-practitioner reveals interesting information about the properties of fish glue derived from the process of its production and the materials involved. This is apparent in his directions to use “spirits” (understood here as alcohol)<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> in making and tempering the fish glue, as it seems he believed this would impart a desirable consistency to the glue. Also, the author-practitioner’s reference to breaking down the fish glue into very small particles is very likely related to the process of its dilution into a clear mixture as it is being boiled down in water—as I will demonstrate in my own reconstruction of the fish glue recipe on fol. 7r.</p>
<h2 id="reconstructing-fish-glue">Reconstructing Fish Glue</h2>
<p>I designed three fish glue experiments, each of which uses a different part of the fish. My first experiment was modelled after the information provided by the author-practitioner on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7r/f/7r/tl"><span class="underline">7r</span></a> and thus renders glue from codfish skin. However, my second and third experiments moved to another level of analysis, based on my examination of the author-practitioner’s references to “clear,” “very clear” and “quite clear” glue in the following group of entries: fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/75r/f/75r/tl"><span class="underline">75r</span></a>, “Bronze of copper” (“Take some verdet &amp; clear glue &amp; grind it together”), fol. 75v, “Gilding wood” (“put down a layer of very clear glue”), fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/78r/f/78r/tl"><span class="underline">78r</span></a>, “Another varnish” (“put down a coat of very clear glue”), fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/78v/f/78v/tl"><span class="underline">78v</span></a>–79r, “For making bronze” (“mix it with very clear glue” and “lay down on it one layer of very clear glue, &amp; let it dry”), and fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl"><span class="underline">79v</span></a>, “Making varnish” (“lay a coat of quite clear glue”). Despite the specificity of these terms (“clear glue,” “very clear glue,” “quite clear glue”), any material distinction between these glues remains ambiguous, as there is no information within Ms. Fr. 640 to indicate what, exactly, clear glue is (i.e., is it a quality, a material, or both?).</p>
<p>The author-practitioner’s emphasis on clear glue and his diverse applications of it within the manuscript motivated me to also experiment with making fish glue from the air bladder of the fish as well as from the membrane encasing it to see if I could produce a glue with the kind of clarity that he seemed to be concerned with.</p>

<p><span class="pull-left"></span>Taken together, these three experiments demonstrate that one can, in fact, easily attain various degrees of transparency in glue from different fish parts, in this case, with the skin, air bladder membrane, and the actual air bladder. However, as my research shows, each material produces its own distinct kind of transparency and color. Interestingly, each of the three fish glue types appears to have comparable strength, as I discuss below. The transparency and strength of a given glue were certainly important qualities to the author-practitioner, as evidenced in the folios cited above. My experiments respond to the ideas and engagement with fish glue that the author-practitioner possibly had. The following series of fish glue experiments, “Codfish Skin,” “Air Bladder Membrane,” and “Air Bladder,” thus deals with and explores a universal tool throughout the manuscript—glue.</p>
<h2 id="experiment-1-codfish-skin">Experiment 1: Codfish Skin</h2>
<p>My first experiment in making glue from codfish skin constitutes a useful starting point in assessing what the author-practitioner was looking for in “clear glue.” Could his various references to clear glue actually be a product of various kinds of fish glue? Of course the author-practitioner mentions mouth glue and starch glue, though not as much as he does fish glue. It remains to be seen through further research and experimentation whether mouth and starch glue could in fact share the qualities of fish glue that he seems to so highly prize.</p>
<p>During the reconstruction I encountered some hurdles I did not anticipate in my textual analysis of this recipe.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> For example, codfish has a black colored tissue that is part of the skin (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>), which proved very hard to remove, and the bits that remained did not in fact dissolve. Indeed, some of the skin itself also failed to fully dissolve (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 9</span></i>). Nonetheless, I cleaned all the meat residue from the skin, but when I cooked it, I noticed that the color of the water in which I was simmering the skins quickly turned yellowish—faster than I wished, since I had hoped that with this experiment I could produce a very clear glue. The end result was not very clear; rather, when the glue cured, it was almost opaque and a pale yellowish-brown (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 10</span></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_056_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDNE9HTHRTQjJNZkU.jpg" alt="fig. 6"><figcaption>Fig. 6.

<p>Other unanticipated things occurred during my experiment with the codfish skins for which the author-practitioner had not prepared me. Although I cooked the skins for approximately eight hours, they still did not dissolve (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></i>). However, I could discern that the water was getting tackier and tackier as the mixture gradually reduced. By the time I decided to turn off the heat, only a little water remained, just enough to cover the bottom of the pot where the mixture was. I filtered the fish skin residue and poured the resulting mixture—the glue in its liquid form—into a baking tin and placed this into the oven at 300° F for about forty minutes in order to further reduce the water. After more than a quarter of the water had evaporated, I took out the baking tin, poured the remaining glue onto foil (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 12</span></i>), and let it harden (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 13</span></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_056_sp_17/1vV69D6gkL7IzyXRcLk5OlXSKKreyH4tH.jpg" alt="fig. 11"><figcaption>Fig. 11.

<h2 id="experiment-2-air-bladder-membrane">Experiment 2: Air Bladder Membrane </h2>
<p>I was inspired to design this experiment based on a YouTube video produced by a fly fisherman entitled “Making Fish (Air Bladder) Glue,” which shows his process for making fish glue using an air bladder of a fish.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> However, it was not at all apparent to me in watching this video if the person was also using its membrane; in fact, I believe either he did not separate the membrane from the air bladder or he was only using the air bladder (likely the former). I came to this conclusion only after I handled the fish air bladder myself and realized that it was encased in a rubbery, clear and flexible tissue-like substance (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 14</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 15</span></i>). It was at this point that I decided to craft a separate experiment that used just this membrane, as I believed that because of its transparency, it might produce a clear glue.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_056_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDOTI4emgxWUpvcFk.jpg" alt="fig. 14"><figcaption>Fig. 14.

<p>The results were perfect. The glue that I made from this membrane is considerably clearer than the codfish skin glue from experiment 1; in fact, this glue is almost entirely transparent (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 16</span></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_056_sp_17/1Jw8aRlfZbu6waO-mskD7mmuUqfu7DwCU.jpg" alt="fig. 16"><figcaption>Fig. 16.

<h2 id="experiment-3-air-bladder">Experiment 3: Air Bladder</h2>
<p>My third and final experiment used the air bladder itself, stripped of its membrane. The organ was a much tougher material to work with than its membrane. It resisted being cut up into small pieces, though I succeeded by using strong tailor’s scissors (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 17</span></i>). This material took around the same amount of time to render into glue as did the codfish skins—i.e., approximately eight hours—however, it did not dissolve as thoroughly as the membrane did, and its color was yellower (though lighter than that of the codfish skin) (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 18</span></i>). Its resulting transparency was somewhere between that of experiments 1 and 2 (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 19</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 20</span></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_056_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDT3duUnFXcTZYNTg.jpg" alt="fig. 17"><figcaption>Fig. 17.

<h2 id="fish-glue-strength-test-the-jig">Fish Glue Strength Test: The Jig</h2>
<p>I designed the following procedure to test the bond of the three different types of fish glue that I made:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I mixed each type of fish glue with a little water and then heated them in separate containers in the oven to melt.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Once each glue was melted, I spread a small amount onto two rectangular pieces of flat grained red oak wood that I had first cleaned with 100 grit sandpaper to ensure they were free from dust and oil. I chose red oak wood because it is commonly used to make furniture.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The joining together of these two wood pieces is called a jig, and I created three separate jigs to test my three different fish glues; each jig is L-shaped, constituting a right angle (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 21</span></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_056_sp_17/1KJVYgkvqxBS-B92ibfCbna7AHEZZ0TV8.jpg" alt="fig. 21"><figcaption>Fig. 21.

</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After I had spread a small amount of glue onto each joint, I clamped each jig together with an F clamp (which can generate about 200 lb of pressure). I allowed the three jigs to dry for twenty-four hours.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>After this period, I released each jig from its F clamp, and I then beveled and sanded the two ends of each jig; this was done in preparation for applying pressure to the jig for the next step, i.e., the “snap test” (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 22</span></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_056_sp_17/175lOz1Zy32O4PUdG_Rh_wWChkv8dK0Pc.jpg" alt="fig. 22"><figcaption>Fig. 22.

</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I returned the newly beveled jigs to their F clamps and applied pressure to each one until the pieces snapped (the “snap test”) (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 23</span></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_056_sp_17/18Gd3aRx-n-th7rAE5MTSo9qUgcu5l7Sx.jpg" alt="fig. 23"><figcaption>Fig. 23.

<li><blockquote>
<p>The results were excellent: each jig snapped in such a way that a thin layer of wood from the broken-off piece remained on the piece to which it had been glued, showing the strength of the bond between the two wood pieces. If the two wood pieces had simply separated under pressure, it would mean that the glue was ineffective as it had failed to adhere the pieces together<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 24</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 25</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 26</span></i>).</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_056_sp_17/1uPSemJkEUBYvpT5wZsHU9vBZyz75FIB7.jpg" alt="fig. 24"><figcaption>Fig. 24. “Snap test” result, demonstrating the adhesive property of the codfish skin glue.

<p>I made a fourth jig as a control, using a modern industrial glue called “Titebond” Original Wood Glue.

</ul>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>I was inspired to create this simple jig to test the strength of my fish glues by the online article “Science Projects for Testing the Strength of Glue” by Jeremy Nicholson<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> as well as by the author-practitioner’s directions on fol. 155v, where he advises joining the delicate parts of the rose with fish glue instead of solder. I recognized in the author-practitioner’s directions in this entry that when the leaves would be attached to the stems of the rose (“being so thin” and thus so “hard to solder”) they would constitute an angled joint. Thus, the angle of my jig mimics the possible angles of these delicate parts because a right angle is fragile and difficult to bond in woodworking.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The author-practitioner has definite ideas about the use, application, and qualities of glue as an adhesive and surface conditioner. He seems most concerned with clearness and strength. My reconstructions demonstrate how simple it is to make different kinds of fish glue that possess various degrees of transparency, and my jig tests show their strength. These material discoveries point to possible meanings behind the references to “clear glue,” “very clear glue,” and “quite clear glue” throughout the manuscript as well as those to strength, such as the one made on fol. 159r that fish glue “holds strongly.” My observations invite further investigation into the nature of the “clear glue” that is mentioned throughout the manuscript. For my part, I am impressed by the author-practitioner’s sophisticated understanding and handling of this important artisanal tool, and by the transmission of craft materials and practices from the Renaissance to the modern age.</p>

<li id="fn9" role="doc-endnote"><p>For example, Christian Laborie, a viola da gamba maker currently operating in France, states that “we use animal glue because the bond is strong and reversible. I use fish glue especially for gluing the top (soundboard) and hide glue (used hot) for other operations like setting the fingerboard (ebony wood) on the neck and gluing the neck to the body.” This information was imparted to me by email correspondence with Mr. Laborie on April 5, 2017. It appears that Laborie’s use of fish glue in instrument making has to do with reducing the tension that the tightened strings will place on the joint between the soundboard and the side of the instrument. Therefore, the tensile strength of this adhesive is necessary to connect these parts. Bow making constitutes another example of the benefits of using fish glue to bond different parts together in order to ease possible tension on the joints; see “Topic: Making Fish Glue ?” Discussion Forum, Primitive Archer, last updated March 30, 2013, <a href="http://www.primitivearcher.com/smf/index.php?topic=38825.0.For"><span class="underline">http://www.primitivearcher.com/smf/index.php?topic=38825.0</span></a>.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
