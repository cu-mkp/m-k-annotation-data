<h4 id="vera-keller">Vera Keller</h4>
<p>Where might we be able to situate our anonymous author-practitioner between a world of craftspeople and that of scholars? The author-practitioner himself gives us many clues about where he lies between the workshop and the scholarly study, most of all by suggesting that he may have intended to title his planned book <em>The Workshop</em> (<em>La Boutique</em>). But the story of his relationship with the learned world is not as simple as it might seem at first.</p>
<p>In the notes the author-practitioner drew up seemingly for the preface for his planned public work, he reaches out to his audience. Here, he promises to expose the material knowledge of his workshop to what seems to be a version of the Republic of Letters, that is, an imagined country in which scholars reached across national and religious boundaries to share their knowledge through an exchange of texts. This was typically known in Latin as a commerce of letters (<em>commercium literarium</em>), which is how the author-practitioner characterizes his own activities.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As small peddlers lay open small wares in order to buy richer ones &amp; to profit more and more, so I, from a desire to learn, am exposing what little is in my workshop to <del>have it</del> receive, through a common commerce of letters, much rarer secrets from my benevolent readers (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl"><span class="underline">162r</span></a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-left"></span>While the author-practitioner presents himself as a willing participant in a commerce of letters, he also begins to hint at a somewhat aggressive attitude towards the world of learning that can be found in books. In his analogy of offering his wares for sale, the author-practitioner explicitly hopes to cheat the reader, obtaining something far more valuable from his readers than the wares he sold them.</p>
<p>This might appear to be over-reading the typical praise for the knowledge of the audience to be expected in prefaces addressed to readers at the time. Yet, the author-practitioner goes on to develop an antagonistic attitude towards the world of textual learning, particularly that found in formal academic settings, by attacking the <em>Tablet of Cebes,</em> a popular educational text<em>.</em> He describes the content of his book as scorned by others; just as “the hen carefully searches the garbage thrown out of a house for a crumb or a grain that she divides among her chicks, thus one distributes to orphans that which has been sought among the arts considered vile &amp; abject” (fol. <a href="https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><span class="underline">166r</span></a>). The author-practitioner has acted as the hen, gathering, through a careful search, parts of the arts despised by others but valued by his audience of “orphans.” He goes on to note, “Tablet of Cebes, idle, but the workshop represents all things active” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/166r/f/166r/tl"><span class="underline">166r</span></a>).</p>
<p>How should we interpret this contrast between his representation of “all things active” and the idleness of the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em>? The <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> was an ancient text of the first or second century CE that describes in words and interprets an image of a journey up a mountain supposedly once deposited in an ancient temple. The tablet itself is lost, if it ever existed, and thus represents one of many of the lost objects of antiquity that the author-practitioner discusses.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The text describing the images on the tablet was hugely popular during the author-practitioner’s lifetime, and it was often depicted in prints and paintings; it also gave rise to many other ways of portraying knowledge in similarly hierarchical terms (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_330_ie_19/1DfCFhlhi2TRLFQ42zv0oeTr0_nU_xeoW.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption>Fig. 1. <em>Tabula Cebetis (The Tabula of Cebes or The Journey of Human Life)</em>, Netherlandish, 1573. Oil on panel, 119.5 x 177 cm. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, SK-A-2372. This Christianized version of the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> shows the temple of divine wisdom towering over the landscape. In this version, the mechanical arts (<em>artes mechanicae</em>), symbolized by figures spinning, chopping wood, and working at a forge, are located surprisingly deep within the structure of learning, within the second wall to the right. They have not yet begun the ascent to more abstract knowledge, however.

<p>The <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> portrays the development of a human, as the individual passes through several levels of a hierarchical education. At the start of the journey, the student must distinguish between the world of the body and its desires, which must be left behind at the very start of their academic journey, and the realm of philosophical contemplation, a higher wisdom (“<em>sapience</em>”), which was their ultimate goal. The seeker of wisdom in the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> must pass through three gates. First, they must choose bodily virtue. Only then could they enter the second gate, where they might choose the path of intellectual virtue. In some ways, the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> supported the role of the mechanical arts on the path to knowledge. After all, they are part of the journey, and in fact, found surprisingly far along the path to knowledge, within the second inner wall, in the same circle as the liberal arts (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>). However, both the liberal and the mechanical arts must be left behind for the student to ascend to the mountain’s top.</p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="https://edition-staging.makingandknowing.org/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_330_ie_19/1Y49Crvs64INyoWoXfQGG_Bq0VvXVep09.jpg" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption>Fig. 2.

<p>By saying that the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> was “idle” and his <em>Boutique</em> was active, the author-practitioner countered one of the central claims of the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em>, that the mountainous path to philosophical speculation was more rigorous than the forms of knowledge practiced on the planes below. The <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> suggested that not everyone could endure the harsh, continually uphill process of shedding an attachment to material things. The author-practitioner recast this detachment as idleness. The voyager abandoned the arts as though they were less valuable than idle speculation. The author-practitioner, like the diligent mother hen, carefully picked up what others did not value.</p>
<p>The author-practitioner was not alone in critiquing the model of pedagogy that the <em>Tablet of Cebes</em> promoted. His contemporary, Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592), in an essay on the education of children, also did so. The goal of education, Montaigne wrote, was <em>vertue</em>, a term that is difficult to translate, more connected with bodily vigor and ability than with the piety that the term <em>virtue</em> connotes today. This enjoyable and courageous <em>vertue</em> was not to be found at the top of a craggy and inaccessible mountain, but on a beautiful, flowering plain. While pedagogues strictly disciplined their students, denying them the ability to follow the path of their desires, <em>vertue</em> was the enemy of fear and constraint. <em>Vertue</em> had nature as its guide and fortune and bodily pleasure as its companions.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike the mountainous landscape of the <em>Tablet of Cebes,</em> the author-practitioner did not situate the <em>Boutique</em> along a hierarchy of knowledge. The <em>Boutique</em> offered a form of universal workshop in which many different forms of experimentation and craft practice intermingled.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> As was the case for Montaigne’s <em>vertue</em>, in this pleasant plane of instruction, nature acted as the guide.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
