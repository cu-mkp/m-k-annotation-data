<h2 id="introduction"><span dir="ltr">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The entry “Thick varnish for planks,” beginning on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><span class="underline">3r</span></a>, contains a schematic illustration of a distillation vessel (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1)</span></i> on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><span class="underline">3v</span></a>, along with a description of its ability to distill high quality turpentine and alcohol in large quantities. To understand the place of this device in the contemporaneous development of distillation technologies, this essay explores questions about where the author-practitioner obtained his information about distillation and why he was interested in it. After discussing the entry on fol. 3r-v and the accompanying illustration, I compare the distillation apparatus with other contemporaneous vessels and descriptions, and then I contextualize the entry by looking at other visual and textual representations of practical apparatuses and processes within the manuscript. I argue that it is likely the author-practitioner may have been more intent on addressing the practical needs of a distillation apparatus than on the means by which an apparatus works. One can posit that the author-practitioner himself may have learned of the vessel experientially, and thus he depicted the distillation apparatus as a practical object capable of specific outputs.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_055_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDRHp2dDZvZzV0TW8.png" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 1.

<p><span dir="ltr">Today, distillation is defined as a process of vaporizing a liquid mixture (known as a “distilland”) by heating it in a boiling vessel or pot and condensing the vapors of a component of the mixture (known as the “distillate”) on a cool surface into a receiver. The result of this process is the collection of more volatile liquid components of the mixture in the receiver and less volatile components in the original boiling vessel. In conventional modern distillation apparatuses, the original liquid mixture is placed in the boiling flask, and once the mixture reaches the vapor temperature, volatile liquid components will vaporize and condense on a slanted condenser continuously fed by cold water on its outside, yielding the collection of this component in the receiver.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Distillation is the standard means for the production of alcohol spirits, essential oils, herbs, and now laboratory-grade chemicals and reagents.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">During the early modern period, practitioners developed these technologies and a diverse group of authors catalogued their techniques. Hieronymus Brunschwig (c. 1450 - c. 1512) authored two works on distillation, <em>Liber de arte distillandi, de Simplicibus: das buch der rechten kunst zü distilieren die eintzigen ding</em> (1500) and <em>Liber de arte distillandi de compositis: das buch der waren kunst zu distillieren die Composita unn simplicia und daz Buch thesaurus pauperum</em> (1507),</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">which contained contemporary methods for constructing a distillation apparatus and performing distillations.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">One of the greatest challenges for early modern distillers was the construction of effective condensers for cooling the distillate. Brunschwig describes a “Moor’s head alembic,” similar to that depicted on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><span class="underline">3v</span></a> of Ms. Fr. 640, in which he admits to not fully understanding the mechanism of circulating water to cool the vessel and illustrates a method of tapping cooling water from the bottom of the apparatus (</span><span dir="ltr"><i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Conrad Gesner (c. 1516–c. 1565), whom the author-practitioner cites in a margin in Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 119v, was one of the first authors to write extensively on the use of water to cool distillates.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> His <em>Thesaurus Evonymi Philiatri de Remediis Secretis</em> describes various types of water-based cooling apparatuses, including a Moor’s head alembic, although none of these apparatuses illustrates a continuous cooling mechanism.</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_055_sp_17/1zqIKa3dp_FLbOpHfIoO_dMF3-cv623D1.png" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 2.

<p><span dir="ltr">The illustration of the distillation apparatus on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><span class="underline">3v</span></a> is one of many sketches throughout the manuscript, which serve a variety of purposes.

The ways in which the author-practitioner illustrates and writes about this sketch helps to elucidate aspects of his knowledge, motivations, and ultimately his identity.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="distillation-apparatus-on-fol.-3v"><span dir="ltr">Distillation Apparatus on fol. 3v</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The only explicit description and visual representation of a distillation apparatus in Ms. Fr. 640 appears on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><span class="underline">3v</span></a>, in the context of entries on turpentine and its use for varnishing floorboards and panel paintings. The author-practitioner notes that this copper distillation vessel is able to produce large amounts of “turpentine oil” of particular qualities. He outlines a few of the parameters under which a distillation should be undertaken, noting that the process should start with low heat, which can be done without a furnace, and that this particular distillation apparatus has a still head cooled by flowing water. He then states the price one can get for the distilled turpentine and also mentions that the colophony, called <em>pix graeca</em>, remains in the vessel after a distillation. He also notes that the apparatus can produce alcohol in a single distillation.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner’s sketch of the apparatus features the typical components of an early modern distillation apparatus:</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> a cucurbit, which holds the distilland; a still head, or <em>ambix</em>, on which the vaporized distillate condenses; a delivery tube, or <em>solen</em>, protruding from the right side of the vessel, through which the condensed distillate is dispensed, and a collecting receptacle, known as the <em>bikos</em> (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The sketch also depicts the cooling mechanism as a basin surrounding the still head and featuring a spigot from which water heated during the distillation can be drained.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_055_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDcVVna1ROVV9vVjg.jpg" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 3. Distillation apparatus, Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 3v., Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. Source: gallica.bnf.fr., labelled by Christopher Eom.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">Though the author-practitioner appears to be illustrating a particular type of distillation apparatus, he describes it in the accompanying text with the simple term “vessel” (<em>vaisseau</em>). Use of the word <em>vaisseau</em> elsewhere in the manuscript shows that it is a generic term used to indicate a receptacle for holding or storing things, rather than as a means of processing materials, such as through distillation.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Comparing the illustrated vessel to contemporary illustrations and descriptions of distillation apparatuses, it can be more or less identified as a Moor’s head alembic. This alembic featured a still head enclosed in cooling water, a technology believed to have been developed in the late fifteenth century.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This type of apparatus is illustrated in Hieronymous Brunschwig’s text (Fig. 2).</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner’s sketch of the apparatus on fol. 3v closely resembles a printed image from the 1551 edition of Brunschwig’s <em>Distillierbuch der Rechten Kunst</em> (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Both apparatuses (Fig. 3 and <i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>) feature a spigot on the left of the cooling vessel surrounding the still head, which would allow water to escape the vessel. The tube leaving the right of both apparatuses may indicate the same <em>solen</em> where the distillate could be dispensed. Brunschwig’s vessel, like that of fol. 3v, appears to enable the distillation of alcohols, as indicated by its caption: “The common distillation vessel / for spirits and other things / now most commonly used / at the top with a copper cooling kettle</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> / from which one can also draw the water off / very useful.”</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Brunschwig specifies the need for a copper condenser on top (<em>küpfferinen Külkessel</em>), but does not specify the composition of any other component of the vessel. This may indicate that it is the condenser which must be made from copper, which is logical, as the low specific heat of copper facilitates the cooling of the still head and the transfer of heat to the water and thus allows for efficient condensation of distillate products.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_055_sp_17/1lJ-p4cgu6BH1H_6jy69ZMhLNZKNUPZCQ.jpg" alt="fig. 4"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 4.

<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner, on the other hand, notes that the entire vessel should be made from copper. It is not clear whether the cucurbit or other components of the vessel were also made from copper, but his recommendation to use tinned copper (i.e., copper plated with tin) to avoid a green color in the distillate may suggest the components besides the still head would also have been made from copper. Because the still head is one of the colder parts of the apparatus (because it is cooled by water), it is less likely that reactions with the copper would occur there.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner’s description of the distillation apparatus raises questions about the quantity and quality of distillate that it produced. He reports that this apparatus is able to produce turpentine oil at the rate of “a bucket an hour.” It is not clear precisely what volume a “bucket” signifies, but the author-practitioner makes clear that it is used to produce “large quantities.”</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">He also describes its ability to make “fine” or “crude” turpentine though he does not specify how these different qualities are achieved through the distillation process. When writing about the distillation of alcohol in the same vessel, the author-practitioner states that “there is no need to distill it again.” This apparently speaks to the quality or purity of alcohol distillate that can be obtained with this vessel, and it seems to testify to the high efficiency achieved with this apparatus.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The text of the entry, with its allusions to tacit knowledge (e.g., “as you know”), indicates that the author-practitioner had some familiarity with distillation techniques and expected as much from his reader. He suggests that one begin a distillation on low heat and, as Brunschwig also mentions, that one can maintain cold water within the still head throughout the process. The author-practitioner specifies the sale of turpentine distilled by his vessel, stating that it “is sold for 40 sous per lb,”</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> a monetary value that is equivalent to 144 deniers or about half a pound of silver.</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This mention of the sale of the product of distillation may suggest that the author-practitioner was involved in a commercial endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="contextualization-of-fol.-3r-v-within-ms.-fr.-640"><span dir="ltr">Contextualization of fol. 3r-v within Ms. Fr. 640</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">There are diverse references to distillation, other distillation apparatuses and the products of distillation throughout Ms. Fr. 640. Chiefly, the author-practitioner mentions the use of an alembic for distillations of urine, azure and turpentine.</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> The forms of the word “lembick,” “limbeck,” or the like were also used to describe the head of these distillation apparatuses from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, and this terminology also occurs in Ms. Fr. 640.</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In his references to alembics, the author-practitioner specifies that a copper vessel should be used. In the entry, “To relieve the pain of G.,” probably referring to gout, he writes that a distillation of imbibed urine should be done “in an alembic, well-luted &amp; covered with a copper helmet” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/7v/f/7v/tl"><span class="underline">7v</span></a>). In yet another entry on “Painting <em>esmail d’azur</em> in oil,” he writes about a “rock water,” that is, “a water distilled from mines where azure or <em>vert d’azur</em> is found, which distills naturally through the veins of the mountain or is distilled through an alembic from mineral stones of azure or copper” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl"><span class="underline">11r</span></a>).</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While the author-practitioner noted his interest in the market value of distilled turpentine, he was also interested in the product left over after such a distillation. The description of the distillation vessel mentions a colophony known as <em>pix graeca</em>, or “Greek pitch,” that remains after a distillation. Though there is never another reference within the manuscript to <em>pix graeca</em> directly, there is a reference to the making of colophony on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><span class="underline">3r</span></a>. The author-practitioner states that it is “nothing other than recooked resin.” The rest of the entry focuses on the production of colophony, in which the author-practitioner implies that it does not directly involve any sort of distillation procedure or the like. However, given the placement of the descriptions and making of colophony on the same single folio page as the distillation entry, it seems as though the entries on colophony and on distillation complement each other. The distillation entry on fol. 3r-v may serve to explain another “origin” of the materials outlined in a previous entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3r/f/3r/tl"><span class="underline">3r</span></a> focusing on colophony.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Contemporary sources on colophony echo the author-practitioner’s brief remarks. Charles Estienne’s <em>L’agriculture et maison rustique</em> briefly makes reference to colophony as a melted substance that can be used for “diseases of the flanks” in oxen in a chapter on “the neat-heard,” or cowherd.</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Conrad Gesner refers to colophony in his <em>Thesaurus Euonymi Philiatri de remediis secretis</em> as a byproduct of balms intended “to close and heale wounds &amp; biles,” including those prepared by distillation and/or with turpentine.</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">These references reinforce the notion that the distillation of turpentine under heat was also a major source of colophony.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Just as we can situate the entry on fol. 3r-v within a network of information about distillation that extends throughout the manuscript, we can also compare the author-practitioner’s sketch of the distillation apparatus with his other drawings in Ms. Fr. 640. Perhaps the most notable feature about the various illustrations in the manuscript is the high variability among them. Whereas an illustration such as that found on fol. 3v is rather schematic and simple, that of fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/54v/f/54v/tl"><span class="underline">54v</span></a> illustrating a contraption for drying jams (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>), for instance, is extremely detailed not only its depiction of component parts, but also in the artistic attention paid to it, including the shading to illustrate liquid and the cross-hatching motif representing the sieve described in the text.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_055_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDcVBHWkhmamRNcVk.png" alt="fig. 6"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 6. Tub with a sieve for drying preserves, Ms. Fr. 640, fol. 54v. Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. Source: gallica.bnf.fr. Example of detailed artistic rendering in the manuscript.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">Two folios feature illustrations similar in execution to that on fol. 3v. The entry titled “Fountains” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80r/f/80r/tl"><span class="underline">80r</span></a> describes a means by which one can raise water from a lower to higher area. This entry is similar to that of the distillation apparatus, as both involve the processing and movement of a liquid medium. Also, they both include illustrations of the apparatuses as well as textual indications of their wider practical purposes. On fol. 80r, the author-practitioner goes into great detail about how to assemble such a contraption in order to achieve this end, and this is reflected in the three illustrations devoted to the practice of feeding fountains with water (<i><span class="underline">Fig 7</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 9</span></i>). The author-practitioner demarcated certain components of one such device with letters, which suggests he could have had a construction of this contraption in mind or was copying the construction from another source. The illustrations here are similarly schematic to the diagram on fol. 3v for distillation.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_055_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDX1dMLXp6YkFCUGM.png" alt="fig. 8"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 8.

<p><span dir="ltr">Perhaps the strongest parallel to fol. 3r-v entry within Ms. Fr. 640 in terms of the subject of an illustration is that of fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102r/f/102r/tl"><span class="underline">102r</span></a>. The illustration featured here is of a glass vessel which, like that on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/80r/f/80r/tl"><span class="underline">80r</span></a>, is achieved with a degree of artistic finesse, as the cross-hatching and curved lines accentuate the form of the vessel (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 10</span></i>). However, what is most intriguing about this entry is the text associated with it. Although very simple, the glass vessel has very clearly outlined specifications, including the particular shape and a relative sense of scale with respect to easily accessible objects, such as knife handles, Dutch feathers, and fingers. Both of these features completely juxtapose the comparable features of the illustration and text of fol. 3v, in which the illustration is quite schematic and the text offers little with regards to the dimensions of the vessel, even though both illustrations concern similar subjects. However, more noteworthy perhaps are the allusions to distillation apparatuses on the same folio. Further up the page is an entry for the “Provisions for the work of Colchis,” which simply features a list of materials (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102r/f/102r/tl"><span class="underline">102r</span></a>). Among these materials are “7 retorts,”</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">“6 <em>terrines</em> without lead,” “2 alembics for distilling vinegar.”</span><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Whether the illustration at the bottom of the page is correlated with the retorts alluded to further up is uncertain, though given that these retorts are the only other reference to a glass vessel on the folio, it is possible.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_055_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDSEFnM3Y3VkdOQmc.png" alt="fig. 10"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 10.

<p><span dir="ltr">Ultimately, the fol. 3r-v entry and illustration appear to be observational rather than a set of instructions. It is not detailed enough for a reader to fully understand the mechanism of distillation, and thus the apparatus cannot be reconstructed on the basis of the entry alone. Rather, it is a way for the reader to understand the practical value of the apparatus and its products.</span></p>

<h2 id="technological-developments-in-vessel-cooling-technologies"><span dir="ltr">Technological Developments in Vessel Cooling Technologies</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">One of the most innovative aspects of the vessel depicted on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/3v/f/3v/tl"><span class="underline">3v</span></a> is its cooling system. The development of a water-cooled copper still head likely began with attempts to perform distillations of alcohols and the need for precise cooling methods and heating control during distillation processes as well as for collecting a desirable yield of pure alcohol products.</span><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">As such, a crucial aspect of proper distillation of alcohols is the means of cooling different components of a vessel in which a distillation is being done.</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The early development of an improved means of cooling targeted the solen of an apparatus using wet sponges or rags.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The development of more robust glasses and their consequent popularity as a material for distillation vessels in turn allowed for further explorations into more efficient cooling methods.</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Taddeo Alderotti (d. 1295) writes of a cooling method in the late thirteenth century in which a tub of water was built around an elongated, arm-length solen, believed to be in a worm-like shape (canalem serpentinum), to further cool the delivery tube.</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> Later, innovations in distillation technologies focused on the cooling of the still head rather than of the solen, using more continuous and rigorous cooling methods than the replaceable sponges or wet rags used previously. This, in conjunction with the need to collect distillates in fraction with a low boiling point, resulted in the development of the <em>Rosenhut</em> and the “Moor’s head.” The <em>Rosenhut</em>, the earlier of the two alembics and observed in a fully fleshed out form by 1478, was a conical rimmed alembic sitting on a wide-mouthed cucurbit and often made from metals because of their high thermal conductivity for efficient cooling by air.</span><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The prominence of the <em>Rosenhut</em> in the sixteenth century is apparent as illustrated in the title page (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></i>) and seventh plate (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 12</span></i>) of the <em>Nova Reperta</em>, a print series engraved by Jan Collaert I (c. 1525/30 – 1580) after Jan van der Straet (1523–1625).</span><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">However, neither of these illustrations indicate the use of water-based cooling mechanisms for distillation apparatuses, as is provided by the Moor’s head alembic and the apparatus illustrated on fol. 3v.

<p><span dir="ltr">When considering larger-scale production and sale of distilled products, apothecaries appear to have played a considerable role from the late twelfth century and, to a lesser extent, vintners and innkeepers.</span><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Furthermore, in France specifically, the distillers trade was controlled by the state from 1619. Distillation remained a craft reserved for apothecaries and spice-merchants until 1624 and 1634, when statutes were implemented for distillers to be placed within the apothecary guild. The distillers gained their own guild in 1637.</span><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The distillation of essential oils was mostly restricted to monasteries, especially those that had herb gardens, although by the fourteenth century, the plants for essential oils, such as lavender, could be grown on large plantations, such as those in Burgundy. These plants were distilled with water or alcohol in a high-throughput manner, using many stills.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Where did the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 gain his knowledge of the distillation apparatus on fol. 3v? The most extensive works on distillation practices at this time were those of Hieronymus Brunschwig. As noted above, Brunschwig’s <em>Distillierbuch der rechten kunst</em> depicts a distillation apparatus closely resembling the vessel on fol. 3v. At the time of the writing of Ms. Fr. 640, it appears Brunschwig’s works were not translated or readily available in French, thus making it less likely that the author-practitioner would have read his works. This does not preclude the author-practitioner having knowledge of Brunschwig and his apparatuses in German, as the author-practitioner was familiar with German materials and practices.</span><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Conrad Gesner, whose “de lapidibus” is mentioned in a margin of Ms. Fr. 640, also discusses distillation,</span><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">but the closest source of distillation practices to the author-practitioner was Charles Estienne’s <em>Maison Rustique</em>. It highlights several characteristics of distilling alcohols, essential oils and other forms of liquid products. Estienne outlines the ways in which <em>aqua vitae</em> is distilled, describing the vessels and procedures, aiming, like the description on fol. 3v, for high yield. He also describes the consequences of multiple distillations, including the relative amount of product and quality of the distillate. He likewise uses the same unit of “bucket” as a means of quantification of product yield. Finally, and perhaps most notably, Estienne includes details about the distillation vessels, including those made from copper.</span><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">One particular illustration closely resembles the alembic found in Ms. Fr. 640, as it depicts what appears to be a water-cooled still head with the same spigot and collection components illustrated by the author-practitioner (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 13</span></i>). Since this vessel also closely resembles the common distillation vessel of Brunschwig, it is probable that Estienne drew inspiration from Brunschwig’s work, and in turn it is possible that the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 may have drawn inspiration from Estienne’s work.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_055_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDdlZweHRRbUVHejA.jpg" alt="fig. 13"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 13.

<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Distillation was of great interest during the early modern period, and it is not surprising to find that the author-practitioner was aware of and showed interest in the process. This essay has contextualized his description and visual representation of the distillation process using a Moor’s head alembic with a water-cooled still head. Brunschwig’s nearly identical vessel in the <em>Distillierbuch der Rechten Kunst</em>, or Estienne’s description may have been the basis of the sketch on fol. 3v, or the author-practitioner might simply have observed such vessels being used. Neither the author-practitioner’s description of the vessel nor the accompanying drawing provide enough details for a reader to reconstruct the apparatus, and thus the author-practitioner’s interest appears to have been in practical processes and the products that could be produced with relatively novel technologies—namely, with a water-cooled copper condenser. His apparent interest in the commercial aspects of these distilled products may likewise prove significant for interpreting other sections of the manuscript. Ultimately, his interest in distillation appears not unlike his interest in many other processes described throughout the manuscript, that is, motivated by practical uses and interest in the means of transforming materials.</span></p>

In both cases, the merit of the use of a vessel lies in the particular shape and size of the vessel rather than its use as an active component of an apparatus, such as on fol. 3v.

<li id="fn18" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr"> I was unable to find anything conclusive about a unit for a “bucket.” In his French-English dictionary, Randle Cotgrave defines a <em>seau</em> (in the original French of the manuscript entry) as “a bucket, or water pale; also, a seale or signet; also, the chiefe <em>Luminaire</em> (wreatbed, or in works) of wax used at funeralls,” a definition that still does not indicate the use of the word <em>seau</em> as a unit. See Randle Cotgrave, <em>A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues</em> (London: Adam Islip, 1611), s.v. “seau,” Online, http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cotgrave/. This led me to wonder whether the use of “bucket” as a measure was an arbitrary unit rather than an established one. It may be possible in this case that “bucket” is relative to the size of the distillation vessel in use or refers to a part of the vessel itself. This could be logical, since a scale is not given by the illustration or text of this folio, so any statements about quantification of the product yield would have to relative to the scale of any given apparatus rather than by a concrete standard.</span><a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">A student essay by Marianne Nuij, ““The Use of eau-de-vie in the Reconstruction of Dragon’s Blood,” University of Amsterdam, Spring 2015, explores distillation of eau-de-vie. Nuij examines the same phrase used by the author-practitioner and concludes that this contradicted other references to eau-de-vie found throughout the rest of the manuscript, where it is specified to need multiple distillations to be of the highest quality. When assessing the definition of “quality” with respect to eau-de-vie, Nuij proposes a reference to higher alcohol content as a result of multiple distillations. However, this raises questions about the reason why the author-practitioner specifies that multiple distillations are not necessary with the fol. 3v apparatus. The root of the question becomes whether the other references to eau-de-vie and its quality as a result of the number of distillations performed are with respect to the apparatus the author-practitioner outlines on fol. 3v or not. Perhaps the other references that require multiple distillations for higher quality eau-de-vie are in fact with respect to other typical distillation apparatuses that cannot achieve the potency that his specified apparatus can with simply one distillation.</span><a href="#fnref19" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

With this modification, since the delivery tube was cooler than the still head of the apparatus, the “lip” in the medieval alembic disappeared, as distillate was no longer collected in the still head of an apparatus, and the cooling of the solen became a focal point of adjustment of condensation outside of the still head.

<li id="fn31" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">Many early stills used materials such as glazed earthenware or metals, though such stills could result in toxic products and were generally avoided. Though glass stills were in use, their utility was limited, as early glasses were often fragile and susceptible to melting or shattering at high temperatures. Starting in the thirteenth century, however, glass vessels made in Venice became better able to withstand heat stress, and cucurbits and alembics could be constructed in this improved glass. By the late fifteenth century, glass components, especially those from Venice, were explicitly specified by sixteenth-century authors Hieronymus Brunschwig and Conrad Gesner.
