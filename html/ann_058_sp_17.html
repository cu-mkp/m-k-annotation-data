<h2 id="introduction"><span dir="ltr">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Of the various medical recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, the two for whitening teeth, found on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><span class="underline">46r</span></a> and fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/47r/f/47r/tl"><span class="underline">47r</span></a>, allow us the opportunity not merely to reconstruct the medicinal substances but to test their efficacy as well. While the other medical entries would require living human subjects for such tests, the two tooth recipes can be evaluated by seeing their effects on non-living teeth. This, in turn, allows us to speculate about the author-practitioner’s relationship to the recipes he collected and the nature of the manuscript as a whole: was he simply recording a series approaches? Or was he providing effective remedies? Perhaps both?</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The two recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 show the use of various acid solutions in an early modern practice of tooth whitening. The recipe on fol. 46r requires aquafortis and “oil of sulfur,” which I identified as nitric acid and sulfuric acid, respectively. The other recipe on fol. 47r calls for sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride), alum (potassium aluminium sulfate) and rock salt. Even though the latter recipe contains no acid in the ingredients, both the solutions of ammonium chloride and potassium aluminium sulfate are acidic.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The recipe on fol. 46r also compares the different effects of aquafortis and “oil of sulfur” on teeth. Both recipes detail the side effects or deficiencies of the whitening preparations, and one provides a means to rectify these effects by using clove oil and rose honey.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner thus recorded different approaches to whitening teeth. This allows me to reconstruct the efficacy of the remedies by designing an experiment to compare the formulas and to examine the reactions of the different substances when applied to teeth. Historical reconstruction of medical recipes in a modern chemistry lab generally has a limited ability to evaluate efficacy. The tooth-whitening recipe, however, provides a case through which the reaction of medical substances on human parts can be safely observed. This essay will focus on the reconstruction of the recipes on fol. 46r, the aim of which is, on the one hand, to uncover the rationale of using acid as dental treatment, and on the other, to compare the efficacy of different acid preparations for teeth whitening. Ultimately, exploring the efficacy of this recipe—as a medical recipe—may permit us to speculate about the author-practitioner’s relationship to medicine more broadly and to make comparisons between this type of entry and the non-medical ones contained in Ms. Fr. 640.</span></p>

<h2 id="tooth-remedies-therapeutic-vs.-cosmetic"><span dir="ltr">Tooth Remedies: Therapeutic vs. Cosmetic</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The tooth-related recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 are primarily concerned with cosmetic rather than therapeutic effects.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Mary Lindemann argues the incidence of tooth decay was probably lower in early modern Europe than it is today; it did not become widespread until sugar was introduced as a sweetener in the late eighteenth century.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">That said, teeth still decayed, and tooth pulling was considered one of the surgeon’s arts in the early modern period. Tooth-drawers or surgeon-dentists not only pulled teeth but also treated various tooth-related problems, most of which were toothaches. The analgesics used by early modern Italian tooth-drawers included oil of cloves, brandy, spirits of camphorated wine or camphor oil, guaiac oil, spirits of wine, opium extract, tobacco, Water of the Queen of Hungary (a decoction of rosemary flowers), spirit of vitriol, spirits of nitre, and anodyne drops (laudanum, volatile ammonium, oil, and aromatic salts).</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Many of these substances are found among the ingredients in the tooth-whitening recipes in Ms. Fr. 640. Clove oil was used in both recipes. The spirit of vitriol and spirits of nitre used by Italian tooth-drawers were similar or equivalent to the two main ingredients in the Ms. Fr. 640 recipes—the oil of sulfur and aquafortis. The similarity of ingredients suggests there was no clear boundary between cosmetic and therapeutic practice in the early modern period.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The relationship between therapeutic and cosmetic ingredients built on competing views of how certain materials reacted with teeth. The remedies for tooth-drawers were not directly related to teeth <em>per se</em> but were understood according to humoral theory.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The tooth-whitening recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, as I will argue, suggest efficacy was related to the active properties of the materials—here, two kinds of acid.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="aquafortis-and-oil-of-sulfur"><span dir="ltr">Aquafortis and Oil of Sulfur</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr"><em>Eau forte</em> in French literally means “strong water,” which was also known by the Latin name <em>aqua fortis</em> in early modern artisanal texts.</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It is a strong corrosive acid that contains primarily nitric acid. In the early modern period, aquafortis was conventionally made by distilling nitre (saltpeter) with vitriol or oil of vitriol. Alchemists developed variant recipes with additional or substitute materials, such as sulfur and alum.</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">A more concentrated solution of it was known as “spirit of nitre.”</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Eleven recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 call for aquafortis (see Appendix); its use extends to metalwork, casting, embellishing and therapeutics, as well as to the killing of animals. It can eat through most metals except gold, which makes it a commonly used acid in several kinds of metalwork, especially etching and preparing pure gold. The author-practitioner was aware of its potency. He recorded one recipe on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109v/f/109v/tl"><span class="underline">109v</span></a> that used one drop of aquafortis to kill a snake for lifecasting.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Oil of sulfur is another strong acid used widely in Ms. Fr. 640. A group of nine “oil of sulfur” recipes are found across fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><span class="underline">46r</span></a>–<a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl"><span class="underline">46v</span></a> (in fact, only one recipe on these folios does not concern oil of sulfur). The “oil” was used both in therapeutic remedies and as a material for writers and shoemakers. Oil of sulfur was a highly valued substance in early modern alchemy, where it was also known as “spirit of sulfur.” It was related to another substance, oil (spirit) of vitriol; both of these “oils” we now understand to be sulfuric acid. Each was prepared through distillation. The original mineral (sulfur and vitriol, respectively) was heated until it vaporized and then was collected in a distillation apparatus, where it was converted to liquid form.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Conventionally, oil of sulfur was more valuable than oil of vitriol, likely due to the primacy of sulfur in alchemy. However, by the seventeenth century, alchemists began to realize that oil of sulfur and oil of vitriol were, in fact, the same substance.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Although aquafortis and oil of sulfur were considered strong acids, their applications are distinct in Ms. Fr. 640. Aquafortis is primarily associated with metalwork, while oil of sulfur plays a central role in specialty ink-making and shoemaking as well as in medicine. The corrosive nature of both was noted in the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640: aquafortis was applied in etching metals and snail shells, while oil of sulfur could eliminate inks and corrode paper, parchment, and leathers. These well-known corrosive properties likely motivated the use of the acids in eliminating blackness and stains on the surface of teeth. Yet their potency required careful application either in limited doses or in mixtures containing clove oil and rose honey to diminish the deleterious effects on teeth.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="reconstruction"><span dir="ltr">Reconstruction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">In reconstructing the recipe on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl"><span class="underline">46r</span></a>, I encountered problems with the teeth themselves, the concentration of the acids, and the ambiguity of measurements given in the text.</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">First, I cannot replicate the tooth afflictions of early modern people. It is also impossible to imitate the tartar buildup or blackness of early modern teeth, since these varied according to diet and eating habits. I was fortunate to acquire several deciduous (baby) teeth from a male donor who was born in 1996. The teeth had been kept for more than a decade. Both the nature of baby teeth and their state of preservation make drawing conclusions from the reconstruction challenging. Accepting that reconstruction involves compromise, I decided to soak the modern baby teeth in black tea for two days in order to stain them; this would make it easier to observe any change in color due to the treatments described in the manuscript.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The second major challenge was that the concentration of the acids is neither specified in the recipe nor identified in any other contemporaneous texts. Early modern artisans did not specify the concentration of acid solutions as we do today.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">A previous Making and Knowing research essay on “oil of sulfur” as a writing material used both low and high concentrations of sulfuric acid.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In my own reconstruction, I used a 65% nitric acid solution and a 15% sulfuric acid solution. I made this decision on the assumption that the aquafortis, a substance used mainly in metalwork and thus likely more corrosive, would be more concentrated than the sulfuric acid. Furthermore, as the recipe calling for aquafortis warns that it could have the side effect of ultimately blackening the teeth, I took that to indicate a stronger acid than in the recipe calling for sulfuric acid.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The third issue concerned the measurements in the recipe, which include “drops” and “a nutshell.” They are thus more approximate than exact. I decided to use a glass dropper to measure the drops, and I defined “a nutshell” as 10 ml.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In order to make a full comparison between the reactions of different acid preparations with teeth, I designed six groups:</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">65% Nitric acid</span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Group one: apply nitric acid once without rinsing with water.</span></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Group two: apply nitric acid; rinse with water after ten minutes; repeat three times.</span></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">15% Sulfuric acid</span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Group one: apply sulfuric acid once without rinsing with water.</span></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Group two: apply sulfuric acid; rinse with water after ten minutes; repeat three times.</span></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Mixture of 10 ml clove oil, 10 ml honey and 8 drops of 15% sulfuric acid</span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Apply the mixture; rinse with water after ten minutes; repeat three times.</span></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Water control group</span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Rinse with water three times.</span></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Two of the six experiments above correspond to the instructions in the recipe itself: “Nitric acid Group two” and the “Mixture” group. As the recipes recommend clove oil and honey to correct the corrosive nature of sulfuric acid, it became necessary to observe the reaction of sulfuric acid on its own. The standard process I developed included three repeated cycles of application and rinsing, but I was also curious to see what would happen if the respective acids were left on the teeth without any water rinse. An additional control group using just water seemed indispensable to demonstrate the stains were eliminated by the acids rather than simply washed away by the liquid (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_058_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDQjNyU0F6aWhyLXc.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 1.

<p><span dir="ltr">The experiment showed 65% nitric acid was the most effective for teeth whitening. Most of the tea stains were cleaned after applying and rinsing three times. The 15% sulfuric acid and the “mixture” worked similarly: both removed most of the tea stains while leaving small stains. Unsurprisingly, the water did not eliminate any stains. After soaking for two weeks, the teeth in Group One of both nitric acid and sulfuric acid appeared to have some degree of corrosion. The teeth in the other groups, however, remained similar to their prior state (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_058_sp_17/0BwJi-u8sfkVDbEVRMG1ZSWV6Znc.jpg" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 3.

<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">This reconstruction demonstrates the efficacy of nitric acid and sulfuric acid in whitening teeth. The “side effects” mentioned in the recipe (being corrosive and turning teeth black), however, did not emerge during my experiment. The teeth in the two nitric acid groups showed no sign of blackening. Sulfuric acid is corrosive, but simply adding a rinsing process seems to have diminished the effect. These results appear to contradict the statements in the recipe. Nonetheless, since the remedy was supposed to be used regularly, the side effects of blackening and corrosion might only appear after long-term, repeated application. This reconstruction is still far from a well designed, scientific experiment. There are numerous variables that could have affected the final results. At this stage, however, the reconstruction shows both nitric and sulfuric acids to be effective materials for cleaning teeth. Their reported side effects, however, still need to be demonstrated by a long-term application of the remedy, which is beyond the scope of the current reconstruction.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While the efficacy of the recipes in whitening the teeth could suggest the author-practitioner included medical recipes known to work, our uncertainty surrounding his claims about the side effects make it difficult to determine whether he was providing a remedy or recording different approaches. Further research may help resolve that question. Simply having medical recipes whose efficacy can be tested, however, allows us a means of bringing this type of entry into conversation with other categories of recipe found in Ms. Fr. 640.</span></p>
