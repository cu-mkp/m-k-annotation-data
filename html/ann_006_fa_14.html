<h4 id="emogene-cataldo-and-julianna-van-visco"><span dir="ltr">Emogene Cataldo and Julianna Van Visco</span></h4>
<p><span dir="ltr">Fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl"><span class="underline">84v</span></a> contains four entries, all to do with moldmaking and casting, one of which is entitled “<em>Eau Magistra</em>” for a binding agent for sand molds made from elm roots and wine (which we have explored in the research essay, “‘<em>Eau Magistra</em>:’ Investigating Binders for Sand Molds”).</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">To the left of “<em>Eau magistra</em>” sits a marginal note that reads “Try burnt oysters” (<em>Essaye huitres bruslees</em>). As it turns out, these three words open up many avenues of exploration.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While this marginal note is written directly to the left of “<em>Eau magistra</em>,” it may also belong with the other three marginal notes above it on sands for moldmaking and casting. These all belong with the entry on “Sand” (<em>Sable</em>),” above “<em>Eau magistra</em>.” The puzzle of the placement of “burnt oysters” cannot be solved by visual inspection alone, and it is further compounded by the fact that there are only two other references to oysters in Ms. Fr. 640 which also appear as marginal notes. A note on fol. 80v in the entry “Founders of small works of tin” reads, “Try calcined oyster shells. They are said to be excellent for molding..” On fol. 49r, next to an entry entitled “Casting of Lead,” another note mentions oyster shell, though the meaning is even less clear:</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">“Poncet. They cast with solder that <del>pewterers</del> <sup>glassworkers</sup> use.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Lump of iron</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Calcined <del>iron</del> oyster shell.”</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">These additional mentions of calcined oysters raise the question of what relationship they have to the texts they abut? Is it useful to consider these in the light of Michael Camille’s work which has called attention to both the value of marginalia and the relationship between the author and reader of a text?</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Much recent scholarship explores the early modern reader’s interaction with texts by way of notes, annotations, and images in marginalia, making clear the diverse functions of marginal notes, from directing attention to particular sections, to exegesis, to engaging in dialogue with the author.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">However, these discussions of authority and mediation do not precisely fit the marginalia of Ms. Fr. 640 because the author is both reader and writer (and practitioner). In this case, the marginalia may reflect a second or later iteration of his experiments or a reflection on his experience. Did the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 actually try to work with oyster shells, or did he observe someone else perform this technique?</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">If they are untested suggestions, should they be considered an invitation to experiment?</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">If so, this implicitly raises the issue of the manuscript’s intended audience. This line of inquiry may help shed light on the larger mystery of the author-practitioner’s identity and his composition of the text.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="reconstructing-for-meaning"><span dir="ltr">Reconstructing for Meaning</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">To determine the best interpretation of the marginal note “Try burnt oysters,” we decided to reconstruct it on the basis of both readings.</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>) Two of the references to oyster shells in Ms. Fr. 640 mention calcining (<em>calcinee</em>), while the third speaks of burning (<em>bruslee</em>). According to Cotgrave’s 1611 French dictionary, <em>Calciné</em> is defined as “calcinated, turned into dust, reduced by fire, unto pouder” and the verb <em>calciner</em> means “to calcinate, burne to dust, reduce unto pouder, by fire, any mettal or minerall.”</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This makes it likely that these calcined or burnt oyster shells were being used in making sand molds. No further information on the actual process of calcining, except the application of fire or heat, can be found in Ms. Fr. 640 or other early modern sources. This raised the questions of how the shells should be prepared and heated (at what temperature, and for how long?), and how the oyster shells would be transformed by this process.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_006_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDbXZtQ1VlRTVmdUk.png" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 1.

<p><span dir="ltr">Ms. Fr. 640 mentions calcination is several places. On fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/100r/f/100r/tl"><span class="underline">100r</span></a> in “Vitrified saltpeter,” the author-practitioner describes calcining other stones, suggesting that different heat sources and processes can lead to different levels of purity. In “Molding with cuttlefish bone” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/91r/f/91r/tl"><span class="underline">91r</span></a>, a marginal note reads, “When the lead gets too hot, it calcines.” On fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/83r/f/83r/tl"><span class="underline">83r</span></a>, in “Another for lead” (<em>Aultre pour le plomb</em>) about preparing molding sand for lead casting, the author directs the reader to “℞ finely pestled slate &amp; <del>calcined</del> pumice stone, mixed together. Calcine them in a well covered pot, &amp; thrice stoppered over a good fire, &amp; each time mix them with varnish.” Other materials in Ms. Fr. 640 that are calcined include stone, glass, bone, and other kinds of shells, for example, on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/92v/f/92v/tl"><span class="underline">92v</span></a> an entry “Sand from river tellins and mussels” notes that “The long shells that one finds in fresh water rivers, being calcined, make an impalpable white sand, which molds very neatly.”</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="calcining"><span dir="ltr">Calcining</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Scientific scholarship has studied oyster shells as a problem of shells in landfills, as well as their potential antifungal properties. Raw oyster shells principally consist of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), while calcination of oyster shells yields calcium oxide (CaO).</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The “optimal temperatures for calcination” in one modern calcination experiment was 900°-950°C (1472°-1562°F).</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Another experiment exposed oyster shells to 1050°C (1922°F) and reported that the resultant powder had “turned completely into CaO after the treatment,” and that in order to produce this result, the “shell was washed several times and dried in an oven at 60°C (140°F) for twenty-four hours.”</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">To prepare our oyster shells, we boiled them in water and cleaned them by removing any remaining adductor muscle.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> We then removed the barnacles and other attached shells with hammers and pliers. After the shells had been rinsed in water several times, we contained the shells in a large towel and broke them into smaller pieces with a hammer. We attempted the calcination several times: the first time, we used a small jewelry kiln heated to 1500°F, exposing just a few pieces of shell to the heat.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">After ten minutes, the shells had turned to white, very fine ash.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The next several attempts at calcination were done with a much larger ceramic kiln.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">After several attempts, in which we were able to produce a crushed oyster ash that was gray in color (thus not fully calcined), the shells finally calcined after heating them over a 9-hour period, in which they reached a maximum temperature of 1800°F for an hour. The resulting powder was pure white, smooth, and silky, quite similar in feel to talcum powder. In the pseudonymous Alessio Piemontese’s sixteenth-century <em>De Secreti</em>, this kind of sand—“very soft, as if impalpable”—is described as perfect for making molds in which to cast metal.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">This fully-calcined oyster shell powder was the material we used in two experiments: in the first, we interpreted the oyster ash as an ingredient in a binding agent used to moisten a sand in a making a sand mold; in the second, we used the oyster ash as the sand itself.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In the first process, which produced a decoction of calcined oyster shells and wine, we sought to examine the performance of the decoction as a binder in comparison to the other binders tested.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Modelled on the procedure for creating the elm root decoction in fol. 84v, “Eau Magistra,” we boiled two teaspoons of calcined oyster shells with one cup of inexpensive Cabernet Sauvignon on a hot plate. Upon contact with the wine, the powder immediately turned a teal green, then briefly became a clear emerald green, which then transitioned into a dull, opaque olive green. More research is needed to determine if the dramatic color changes were due to an oxidation reaction. (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>) We poured the mixture into an airtight glass container. After a few minutes, the mixture separated into a watery brown liquid on top and a muddy green mixture on the bottom. A half cup of this decoction was then added to two cups of sifted sand and used for making sand molds.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_006_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDbmxPekV6bU9mUlk.png" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 2.

<p><span dir="ltr">In preparing our sand for molds, we pulverized and sifted previously used molds made of a 2:1 mixture of plaster and pulverised bricks. After stirring the oyster ash and wine decoction, we gradually added approximately half a cup of it to two cups of sifted sand. It was easy to achieve the desired texture for sand molds; the mixture would hold together when squeezed into the palm of the hand, but broke apart with the pressure of a fingertip.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>) This came to be known as the “squeeze test” in the Making and Knowing laboratory.

We poured molten tin into the mold and the resulting cast object was extremely fine in its detail--indeed, the best cast of our experiments. (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>) The mold, however, did not survive; it broke apart and thus could only be used once. (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>) Our test of this entry produced one of the desiderata of a good “sand”—fineness of impression—but not the concomitant durability.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_006_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDWjRoSzFFbVcwazQ.png" alt="fig. 5"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 5: Applying the “squeeze test” of fol. 118v, “Molding in frames”.

<p><span dir="ltr"> In our second experiment, we used the sifted calcined oyster shells as the sand. Two cups of calcined oyster shells were mixed with the whipped egg whites of two eggs. This did not seem to moisten the oyster shell sand sufficiently; the sand seemed to absorb the moisture much more quickly that the brick dust molds--it would not “clump” enough to be a useful packed mold material. Since we ran out of eggs in the lab, we used some of the remaining elm root emulsion we had on hand.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">We kept adding this until the mixture would “clump,” but then the mixture seemed to be wet and dry at the same time: the calcined oyster shells seemed “dry,” but when squeezed, water drained from the mixture. It was as if the calcined shells were both absorbing and repelling the water. (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 9</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 10</span></i>)</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_006_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDVU85ajBTanY2QUU.jpg" alt="fig. 9"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 9: Notice the moisture on the table after packing the calcined oyster shell sand mold.

<p><span dir="ltr">We made our frame mold according to the sand-molding process described in Ms. Fr. 640, fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><span class="underline">118v</span></a>, building the tempered sand around a plaster pattern and leaving the mold to dry.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">We placed extra sand in a plastic cup. Unexpectedly, when we checked on our mold several days later, the sand had expanded out of the frame into a useless, dry pile—the calcined oyster shells had turned to “quicklime.” The exothermic reaction that occurred when the lime present in the CaO reacted with moisture from the air resulted in a mold that “puffed up” and disintegrated. The heat of the exothermic reaction melted and deformed the plastic cup in which we had stored the extra sand. We could not use either the mold or the sand for a metal pour. (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></i>)</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_006_fa_14/0BwJi-u8sfkVDbUttQy02am5kT0U.jpg" alt="fig. 11"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 11: The oyster shell mold produced an exothermic reaction, resulting in the expansion of the sand, which was completely dry and produced no salvageable impression. Emogene Cataldo and Julianna van Visco, The Making and Knowing Laboratory, 2014.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr"> In retrospect, the success of our first experiment of using oyster ash as a liquid binder for sand molding might have been a result of the fine oyster ash mixing with the brick dust and plaster of pulverized molds from previous castings. This could have produced a finer sand that could take a better impression. The manuscript does not say explicitly to mix the oyster shells with another sand, but this was part of the successful molding material. The reaction that produced the brilliant green color in the wine perhaps holds the key to the success of the experiment. The calcined oyster shells had already been exposed to moisture, so they had already undergone a reaction. Meanwhile, the wine still acted as a binding agent in the mold.</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It would be interesting to determine if the oyster ash that produced the exothermic reaction could be used again as a sand in a box mold; perhaps this sand would be capable of hardening and maintaining an impression in which to cast metal. Further experimentation with oyster shell ash is worth pursuing.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">A hands-on approach in the laboratory, paired with textual research and analysis enabled us to explore the ways in which the oyster marginalia might illuminate the compilation of the text and the author-practitioner’s role as both writer and reader of his own text. Our findings suggest that the author-practitioner knew or speculated about the promising properties of oyster shells, but he had yet to perfect a procedure for their successful use. The presence of distancing language, phrases such as “try” or “it is said to be” indicate that the author-practitioner was probably less personally familiar with the use of oyster shells as a material. Perhaps he heard it suggested, or had observed the properties of calcined oyster shells in another context. But in contrast to other more confidently phrased imperatives, such as in “Casting in frames” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118v/f/118v/tl"><span class="underline">118v</span></a>, in which the author-practitioner writes in the first person, on fol. 84v he offers no tips, warnings, or reminders that would suggest a hands-on familiarity with the processes. Perhaps these notes were untested by the author-practitioner and instead intended as suggestions for future experiments, as is perhaps the case with a list of processes on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/169r/f/169r/tl"><span class="underline">169r</span></a>, where the author-practitioner lists many processes, appearing to mark those he has “put” (<em>mis</em>), or even “put and seen” (<em>mis et veu</em>), perhaps indicating those he has actually observed or tried and included in the manuscript, and those he may “try” in the future.</span></p>
