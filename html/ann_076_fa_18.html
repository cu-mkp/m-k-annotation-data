<p><span dir="ltr">Fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><span class="underline">140v</span></a> in Ms. Fr. 640 contains a recipe, “For casting in sulfur,” which instructs the reader to use bread pith (<em>mie de pain</em>) as a mold for sulfur-casting. This process is expanded on in the subsequent entry, “Molding and shrinking a large figure,” located on the same page. Here, the author-practitioner notes how varying casts can be produced from a single object by “elongating” (<em>allongeant</em>) or “shrinking” (<em>apetisser</em>) the bread pith. This is an unusual set of instructions. While bread and bread making feature in a range of craft and artistic recipes, bread molding seems to be almost unique in the written record, found only in one nineteenth-century publication in French, <em>Nouveau Manuel</em>.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The recipes on fol. 140v also provide no information about the purpose of casting objects in varying shapes and sizes or the types of bread used in this process, despite the multitude of bread varieties available in the period of the manuscript’s compilation.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">This essay examines the existence of bread molding in its historical context. It situates fol. 140v alongside bread molding techniques, other uses of bread and bread making in object casting, and broader craft practices in early modern Europe. The essay then tests the viability of drying bread molds to change the shape and size of the mold and thereby the resultant cast, focusing specifically on the “shrinking” of the bread pith in the entry “Molding and shrinking a large figure” on fol. 140v. Through reconstruction, this essay confirms it is possible to use bread molds to take imprints from objects and cast those imprints—both in their original and resized form. Reheating the bread molds also increases and speeds up the shrinking of the imprints. The types and quantities of ingredients used in making the bread, and kneading the bread pith after extracting it from its baked loaf, also affect the clarity of the impressions made.</span></p>

<h2 id="historical-context"><span dir="ltr">Historical Context</span> </h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Bread was a primary staple in early modern Europe.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Considering its ubiquity, surprisingly few recipes for bread exist. Cookbooks and craft manuals nonetheless reveal some of the varieties of bread consumed during the period and how they were produced.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The types of bread available differed in their ingredients, baking methods, and origin.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The English writer John Evelyn (1620–1706) for instance, noted several types of “French bread” contemporaneous to the period, from “House-hold Bread” produced in the domestic space to the “best Bread of France,” the “Pain de Gonnesse.”</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Sold commercially by professional bakers and also made in the household, bread was a quotidian material readily at hand; it is perhaps unsurprising that it was employed in various craft processes, and its properties were often used to make conceptual or qualitative comparisons.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Apart from serving as a source of food, bread was used as an ingredient in a range of recipes within craft and artistic manuals, ranging from simple uses such as for erasing marks of different kinds, to more complicated uses, such as that detailed in the 1685 English edition of <em>Polygraphice</em> (originally published in 1673), in which medical practitioner William Salmon utilized baked bread loaves “To make artificial flesh.”</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In this recipe, Salmon instructs his readers to insert freshly baked wheat loaves into a “bolthead of glass,” before setting it in a temperature bath for two months, so as to produce “fibrous flesh.”</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Similarly, in Hugh Plat’s <em>The Jewell House of Art and Nature,</em> first published in 1594, the English barrister and compiler of artisanal recipes, includes instructions for molding <em>with</em> bread (in contrast to Ms. Fr. 640’s process for molding <em>in</em> bread): “some will mold great, and curious patterns in the crum of fine manchet well tempered into past[e], and pressed hard upon the pattern. Here, “manchet” refers to a fine wheat bread, which is formed into a paste and used to create relief designs.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Extending the use of bread beyond the physical space of a craftsman's workshop, Plat also notes how “crustes of bread” in “broken beere, or flatten milk” could be used to fatten capons “in a more cheap manner.”</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The use of bread as a craft material persevered long after the sixteenth century; its constituent ingredients, such as flour and yeast, would be included in casting recipes of English engineer N.E. Spretson, published in 1892.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Bread not only featured as a physical material within craft and artistic processes, but was used as a tool to manufacture products. For instance, in the recipe “Of making artificial pearls” in <em>Polygraphice</em>, Salmon instructs his readers to place the pearls, made of a mixture of mother of pearl, oil of sulfur, and egg whites, “into a loaf of bread” and bake it “till the loaf is much burnt.”</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">After extracting these “pearls” from the loaves and washing them one was left with artificial pearls “as fair as the truly natural.”</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Plat also uses bread as a tool, exploiting its absorptive quality in his recipe for purifying sallet [salad] oil.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">By placing a “piece of bread or [...] dough” into heated salad oil, Plat claims that the bread will “draw into it selfe all the must[y] and bad taste or s[c]ent” of the oil, thus keeping it “pure and cleane.”</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">As Emma le Pouésard has argued, the ubiquity of bread in early modern Europe allowed for bread and the bread-making process to function as material mediators in craft recipes, helping artisans to clarify unfamiliar technical processes.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Bread was thus used both physically and metaphorically in craft and artistic practices. For instance, Plat’s recipe “how to dry rose leaves…” uses the timing of when bread is “drawn [...] out of the oven” to describe the appropriate moment to place the cake of rose leaves in the oven to dry.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Similarly, in Cellini Benvenuto’s (1500–1571) treatise on goldsmithing and sculpture, he instructs mixing clay and cloth frayings “to the consistency of a dough,” before giving them a “good baking” to produce cores for bronze-casting.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Beyond Ms. Fr. 640, only one other instance of casting objects in bread molds has been found, in <em>Nouveau Manuel</em>, first published in 1828 by M. Lebrun.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">While little is known about the author apart from his membership in “numerous academies,” six editions of this work were published until the year 1917, suggesting sustained interest.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In its 1838 and 1850 editions, bread molding is featured in Chapter X, “Method for molding medals and brooches,” specifically in the recipe “Bread pith molding:”</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Take bread pith while still hot and baked only a little, knead this dough with a rolling pin, add a little bit of aloe so that it does not stick to the glass. Once this preparation is done, take this dough of bread pith and use it to stamp the medal. Use as much care to push it into the cavities as possible. Let dry, turn over the brooch, detach the concave part, and use it to pour the sulfur, the plaster, the talc, the chalk, the wax, but not to stamp again, be it with mastic, the bread pith dough, etc.: you risk obtaining unrecognizable shapes. In general, before molding, examine the brooch or the medal well: if there are a lot of cavities, you can be sure that the stamping probably will not succeed; only bread pith, and especially gelatin, will give you a somewhat satisfying result.</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Following the 1838 edition of Lebrun’s publication, three authors, M. F. -B. Robert, M.Magnier, and M. Valicourt, expanded on and reworked different sections of the <em>Nouveau Manuel</em>, including the bread molding entry; the 1843 edition provides additional steps to take before imprinting the bread:</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Here is how one prepares the material: one takes the pith of a bread as it comes out of the oven, or at least the freshest possible [...] One manipulates it well, then works it with a rolling pin until it is suitable for molding, which can be recognized when [the paste] no longer sticks to the rolling pin, has become elastic, and can be worked with the fingers without it sticking. This manipulation is necessary for this kind of dough so that it shrinks as little as possible, and does not become prone to splitting while drying.</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Given that Lebrun’s <em>Nouveau Manuel</em> was published about two centuries after Ms. Fr. 640 was written, it is not clear if bread molding was commonly practiced in early modern France. Perhaps, like bread baking, bread molding was such a common practice for making test pieces, as a kind of ephemeral intermediate step in larger craft processes, that craftspeople simply passed on the technique by experience rather than by writing it down, and thus neither written nor material evidence survives for the practice. Whether there were continuities or developments in this casting technique over time is also difficult to tell given the limited sources<em>.</em> Nonetheless, Lebrun’s use of bread for molds indicates that the author-practitioner’s practice was not unique.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Lebrun’s method of bread molding, in its various editions, also shares several similarities with the entries on sulfur casting in fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><span class="underline">140v</span></a> in Ms. Fr. 640 (see Appendix). First, the insides of the bread used are “still hot” (<em>chaude</em>), thus fresh from the oven. Second, an imprint is made by pushing the object into the bread pith. Third, one should “let dry” (<em>laisser sécher</em>) this impression, before materials—such as sulfur—can be cast into it. Lebrun’s instructions also include additional steps: separating the bread pith (<em>mie de pain</em>) from crust, adding aloe, and kneading the pith into paste. Further, it details potential pitfalls to avoid to ensure the bread mold’s success, namely, the choice of object for casting (avoid a brooch with too many cavities), as well as the imprinting technique (pushing into the cavities). In the <em>Nouveau Manuel’s</em> 1843 edition, instructions for bread molding also emphasize oiling the imprint before casting, and placing weights on the object as it dries within the bread mold to increase the pressure and thus the depth of the impression made. It also explains the kneading of the bread pith as a method of preventing the mold from shrinking, contrary to the author-practitioner’s aims in fol. 140v.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">To what extent, then, can Lebrun’s recipe, in its various editions, supplement our understanding of the entries on fol. 140v? In other words, did the author-practitioner simply leave out such intermediary steps and notes of precaution in his instructions, or is Lebrun’s method for bread molding a separate technique? Must the bread pith be separated and further manipulated after baking to produce an imprint for casting, or was this only necessary if the goal was for the mold to shrink “as little as possible?” My reconstruction of Lebrun’s method of further manipulating the bread pith to prevent the shrinking of its imprints was inconclusive. However, his kneading process, the instructions to dry out the bread mold before removing the impressed object, and the suggestion to oil the mold before casting, are beneficial in producing imprints, and consequently casts, that capture more of the original object’s details.</span></p>

<h2 id="bread-molding-in-ms.-fr.-640"><span dir="ltr">Bread molding in Ms. Fr. 640</span> </h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">In Ms. Fr. 640, entries on bread molding emphasize the speed and clarity of imprinting on bread pith.</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The recipe “Molding and shrinking a large figure” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><span class="underline">140v</span></a> also notes the possibility of further manipulating the impression in the bread pith:</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Mold it with bread pith, having come from the oven, or, as the aforesaid, &amp; in drying out it will shrink &amp; consequently the medal that you will cast. You can, by this means, by elongating and widening the imprinted bread pith, vary the figure &amp; with one image make many various ones. Bread coming from the oven is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts more. You can cast sulfur without leaving the imprint of the bread to dry, if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">This technique and process of manipulating the bread pith to change the size and shape of the cast object are absent from Lebrun’s bread molding process and so are unique to the manuscript. Here, the author-practitioner exploits the tendency bread has to shrink when drying, which causes a correlative shrinking in any impression made in bread. He also uses the plastic nature of the bread to “elongat[e] and widen” the imprint, in order to make variously distorted casts of the same object.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The inclusion of the entry in the main text of the page, rather than in the margins, suggests that this shrinking process was an intentional supplement to the previous bread molding recipe on the same page. Yet, the recipe offers no explanation on why objects were cast in varying shapes and sizes, and the types of bread used in this process, despite the numerous bread varieties present during the period. Indeed, while Ms. Fr. 640 demonstrates an “appreciation of the characteristics of different flours,” descriptions of the breads used are brief.</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It is also unclear whether the pith must be extracted and further kneaded (as with Lebrun’s entry) or if an object could be imprinted onto the pith of the bread as is. It is thus unclear which specific material qualities or types of bread are of greatest use for bread molding. Combined with the vagueness of the entry’s instructions, reconstruction is therefore useful in clarifying potential intermediary steps taken by the author-practitioner as well as the material qualities of bread used in this process. It also serves as a proof-of-concept that shrinking the bread mold, as described on fol. 140v, is possible.</span></p>

<p><span dir="ltr">For this reconstruction, I prepared nine loaves of bread with varying ratios of organic stone-ground rye, whole wheat, and refined wheat flour, reflecting grains used for bread in the sixteenth century (Table 1). For historical accuracy, these loaves were produced based on an adaptation of John Evelyn’s 1664 recipe for “House-hold Bread.”</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In each batch, equal amounts of flour (340g), salt (6g), homemade sourdough starter (40g), and water (250g) were added and mixed until fully incorporated. This dough was then kneaded until it passed the “windowpane test,” that is, until a portion of the dough could be stretched thin enough for light to pass through without tearing the dough, indicating that the gluten had developed sufficiently through kneading.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This took ten to twenty minutes, depending on the flour mix used (Table 1). Given that the amount of time taken for loaves to rise sufficiently varies depending on the ambient temperature, humidity, and flour mix used, two to three holes were made “in the middle […] to the bottom” of the dough to ensure consistency in the proofing process of the various trials.</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The dough was subsequently left to rise until the “holes […] closed or swelled up,” as per Evelyn’s instructions.</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The dough was then “knocked back” in order to knock the air out of the risen dough.

<p><span dir="ltr">Each loaf was halved immediately as it came out of the oven. Bread molds were then prepared from the baked loaves using two different methods, one for each half of the bread. For the first method, half of the bread was further divided into three to four slices of approximately 1–2 centimeters in thickness, then set aside for imprinting (Method A). For the second method, borrowing from Lebrun’s instructions, the pith of the remaining half of the bread was extracted from its crust. It was then kneaded with a rolling pin until the pith “no longer st[u]ck” to the pin, and a smooth, flat surface of similar thickness as Method A was produced.</span><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This kneaded pith was then quartered (Method B).</span></p>

<p><span dir="ltr">Two copies of brooch- or medal-like objects in three different designs were prepared by casting beeswax into silicone molds (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>). For Loaves #1 to #7, one copy of each brooch design (heart, oval, and diamond) was imprinted into the bread molds prepared with Method A, and another was impressed into the pith produced with Method B, in order to evaluate how each method affected the clarity of the imprints made. The imprinting was done by firmly pressing the objects into the bread piths until they remained in the molds without springing back out. Borrowing from Lebrun’s instructions, the brooches were left in their bread molds and unmolded only when the molds had dried, approximately one to three days later. This method produced clearer imprints than immediately unmolding the objects did.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_076_fa_18/1VVQE2UK5D_cdr5q4beJpuzIjXscU_NAT.jpg" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 2.

<p><span dir="ltr">The number of days between baking Loaves #1 to #5 and casting of each of their imprints was kept as consistent as possible to ensure near-identical durations in the drying out of the bread molds (Table 2). These loaves consequently dried for a span of eight to ten days before casting. The number of days between baking and casting, and thus for the loaves to dry out, was then reduced to three to four days for Loaves #6 and #7 (Table 2). Loaves #8 and #9 were baked and cast on the same day (Table 2). The influence of the drying process on the shrinking of the bread molds, and of the resultant cast, was thus compared between Loaves #1, #6 and #8 (Set A), and between Loaves #2, #7, and #9 (Set B), each set comprised of bread made using the same ingredients.</span></p>

<p><span dir="ltr">For Loaves #8 and #9, three of the four bread molds made from Methods A and B were returned to the oven and kept at a constant temperature of 200°F. In intervals of twenty to twenty-five minutes, a slice prepared according to Method A and one prepared with Method B were taken out of the oven, until all bread molds were removed.</span></p>

<h2 id="v-sulfur-casting"><span dir="ltr">(v) Sulfur casting</span> </h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Before casting, the width and height of the impressions made on Loaves #1 to #9 were measured and compared to the dimensions of their original objects. Sulfur casting was subsequently conducted in two batches, with the first batch consisting of imprints made on Loaves #1 to #7, and the second from Loaves #8 and #9. For the first batch, melted sulfur was poured into these imprints and left for four days to harden before unmolding. To facilitate the removal of sulfur casts from their bread molds, these molds were soaked in water to soften the pith, which had become tough and impliable. Dimensions of the resultant sulfur casts (when successful) were then measured and inventoried.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Given the difficulty of the unmolding process with the first batch, pure cold-pressed linseed oil was brushed onto the bread molds of Loaves #8 and #9 before melted sulfur was cast into the imprints. The sulfur was left for thirty minutes until just solidified. The casts were then unmolded and their dimensions measured.</span></p>

<h2 id="results"><span dir="ltr">Results</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Across all nine loaves, bread molds prepared with Method B, which separates the insides of the bread from its crust before kneading it, consistently produced clearer imprints than those of Method A, where the object was impressed directly into the loaf (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>). Impressions made on molds of Loaves #2, #3, #4, #7, and #9 in particular, which were made from whole wheat flour or a portion of refined wheat flour, successfully captured the details of the original object. These bread molds were moist and inelastic enough for the objects to remain within the impression as the loaves dried, and the pith did not crack when imprinted. On the other hand, loaves #1 and #8, produced entirely with refined wheat flour, produced bread molds that were drier and more elastic. The object consequently did not remain within the bread mold when it dried out, as the pith sprung back when the object was impressed on it. The impression formed was thus light and shallow. Bread molds of Loaf #5, made from 100% rye flour, were sticky and crumbled when sliced; moreover, the bread pith often split as the wax brooches were pressed into the mold, leading to cracks and holes in the imprints. Thus, the types of bread used in the bread molding process influenced the outcome of their sulfur casts, and the inclusion of whole wheat flour, or a portion of refined wheat flour, in the bread was a necessary factor in producing “very neat work,” as the author-practitioner instructs (fol. 140v). Moreover, Method B—separating the bread pith from its crust after baking, and subsequently kneading it—also produced better molds.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_076_fa_18/1jYChk-PLtrtZm-om2cZhM0JK8pNHJnLS.jpg" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 3.

<p><span dir="ltr">Bread molds made using both methods also produced imprints—and consequently, casts—of reduced sizes, confirming the viability of “let[ting] the [bread mold] shrink” by “mak[ing] it dry” (fol. 140v).</span><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">For Loaves #1 to #3, as well as Loaves #8 and #9, bread molds made using Method B demonstrated a comparatively greater average reduction in the dimensions of its imprints compared to those produced with Method A (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> On the other hand, bread molds made using Method A for loaves #4 and #7, both produced with whole wheat flour, yielded imprints and casts with a larger shrinkage than those prepared with Method B (Fig. 4).

<p><span dir="ltr">Comparing the nine loaves, Loaf #1 (made from refined wheat flour) showed the greatest extent of shrinkage in its width, with an average retraction of 0.32 W x 0.16 H centimeters (Fig. 4). Loaf #2 on the other hand (containing 50% rye and 50% refined wheat flour) had an average retraction of 0.26 W x 0.29 H centimeters, shrinking the greatest in height (Fig. 4). Loaves #3 and #4 (containing whole wheat flour) showed similar retractions of 0.19 W x 0.14 H centimeters and 0.20 W x 0.10 H centimeters respectively, while Loaf #5 (made from 100% rye flour) demonstrated negligible shrinkage (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>). Given that the baking method and number of days between baking and casting were kept constant across these five loaves, the types of flour used in making the bread thus influenced the shrinkage of the bread molds as well. Set A, containing loaves made with refined wheat flour, dried out and shrunk more than loaves made with whole wheat flour, as with Set B (Table 3). Further, measurements of imprints from Set A (Loaves #1, #6, #8) and Set B (Loaves #2, #7, #9) indicate that drying out the bread molds for a longer duration increases the shrinkage of their impressions (Table 3). Table 3 also shows that imprints cast on the same day as their molds were produced (Loaves #8 and #9) had identical dimensions to their original objects. This confirms the viability of casting sulfur “without leaving the imprint of the bread to dry” to produce casts as big as their originals, as noted in fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><span class="underline">140v</span></a>.

<h2 id="discussion"><span dir="ltr">Discussion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The clarity of imprints made from bread molds produced with whole wheat flour, or a portion of refined wheat flour (Loaves #2, #3, #4, #7, and #9) suggests there is an ideal level of hydration and gluten for bread used in bread molding. This is reinforced when contrasted with the poor impressions made on Loaf #5. Produced with 100% rye flour, the loaf’s low gluten content, combined with the presence of pentosans (a group of complex sugars) within the dough, results in dense bread that easily breaks apart when mixed or imprinted.</span><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Conversely, the shallow and poor impressions made on Loaves #1 and #8 demonstrate that refined wheat flour, which is high in gluten, was also poorly suited for bread molding. Given that wheat flour was more commonly used in its unrefined form during the period, with refined white flour reserved for “superior bread” consumed by the wealthy, the flour ratios tested here that produced more successful bread molds in this reconstruction were likely more historically appropriate.</span><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This also confirms Emma Le Pouésard’s hypothesis, in her analysis of bread within Ms. Fr. 640, that the bread used by the author-practitioner was wheat bread—more specifically, whole wheat bread.</span><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">That bread molds made using Method B (pith removal) consistently produced impressions that captured greater detail of the original object, as opposed to those prepared with Method A (direct imprinting on loaf), also clarifies the instructions on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><span class="underline">140v</span></a> to mold “with bread pith.” While the author-practitioner does not specify whether to remove the bread pith from its crust in order to produce the bread molds, the success of Method B over A suggests that separating the bread pith from the baked loaf and further manipulating it into a bread mold was a necessary step in the author-practitioner’s bread molding process. Further, for bread molds produced with Method A, bread pith that clung onto the sulfur casts could not be completely removed, even after oiling the imprints (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 8)</span></i>. Imprints on these molds thus failed to produce clean copies of the original design when cast. While Lebrun’s entry suggests that Method B (extracting the bread pith from its crust and kneading it) would prevent shrinkage of the bread mold, the inconclusive results from this reconstruction demonstrate that Method B could still be employed for bread molding per the instructions on fol. 140v. This method compressed the crumb of the loaf, which allowed for the object to be imprinted without the crumb of the bread mold disrupting the details of the design. With Method B, the type of bread used had a smaller impact on the outcome, as the kneading process homogenized the density and openness of the crumb.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_076_fa_18/1xXNDvZduskOwJIh4udpqYIaXRGyJlKEX.jpg" alt="fig. 8"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 8.

<p><span dir="ltr">Lebrun’s instructions to “always oil” the bread molds produced sulfur casts that were easily unmolded, without any remnants of bread on them. The application of linseed oil to the imprints in this reconstruction also had the added effect of preserving the bread molds, allowing repeated casts of the same impression to be made, a real asset for a craftsman who wanted to reuse materials to save both time and money. Just as the author-practitioner failed to clarify what he meant by molding “with bread pith,” he also seems to have omitted necessary intermediary steps within the bread molding entries on fol. 140v—either unintentionally or assuming they were commonly known.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">With regard to the shrinking process, reheating the bread molds increased the rate at which the imprints retracted compared to leaving the impressions to naturally dry out. The author-practitioner’s suggestion to use bread that is “reheated twice” for a greater shrinkage, combined with the reusability of molds, thus provided a quick, accessible, and cheap alternative for a craftsman under constraints of time or resources to produce multiple casts of various sizes (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><span class="underline">140v</span></a>).</span></p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Bread was easily accessible and used in a variety of craft and artistic practices in early modern Europe, but it is unclear whether the bread molding documented by the author-practitioner and Lebrun were isolated instances. My reconstruction thus serves as a proof-of-concept of the process, demonstrating the viability of producing sulfur casts from imprints made on bread. Bread molds into which sulfur was cast may have formed a quick method of testing the sharpness of details or the overall form of a casting pattern in the process of being carved, or to test whether details remained clear when a mold shrank.</span><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Given the wide availability and relative cheapness of bread, such a method could save time and expense. The speed and convenience that bread molding afforded may explain why the author-practitioner mentioned in the entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/140v/f/140v/tl"><span class="underline">140v</span></a> that sulfur could be cast “without leaving the imprint of the bread to dry.”</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">My reconstruction demonstrates that, in the right circumstances, shrinking is also possible. This reconstruction was useful in clarifying the material realities of the rarely-discussed process of bread molding, for instance, determining how different types of breads influence the process and outcome of the mold. In particular, bread molds produced entirely or with a portion of whole wheat flour, which was high in gluten, produced imprints that successfully captured the details of the original object, and demonstrated sizeable shrinkage when dried out and/or reheated. Loaves produced from refined wheat flour, on the other hand, resulted in light and shallow imprints, and consequently, distorted and brittle sulfur casts. Bread molds made entirely from rye flour, which is low in gluten, broke apart easily when manipulated, leading to cracks in the impressions made and demonstrated negligible shrinkage.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">This reconstruction also highlights how Lebrun’s instructions on bread molding, while different from the author-practitioner’s, might reveal necessary intermediary steps within the bread molding process absent in the entries on fol. 140v. This includes separating the bread pith from its crust, kneading it to produce bread molds, and oiling the imprints and unmolding the objects from them only after the molds have dried. Lebrun’s suggestion, however, that removing the insides of the bread and then kneading them would result in bread molds with reduced shrinkage when dried, remains unproven. A detailed, step-by-step reconstruction of Lebrun’s bread molding process and a subsequent comparison with the bread molding entries on fol. 140v in Ms. Fr. 640 would be useful in clarifying this set of instructions and whether the two bread molding methods were intended for different purposes.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Just as bread provided the possibility of casting objects in a reduced size, enabling a craftsman to experiment with scale, the reverse may also be possible; as the author-practitioner notes, one could “vary the figure” by “elongating and widening the imprinted bread pith” as well. Whether or not the elasticity and pliability of bread lent itself to casting objects in larger sizes or in distorted versions of the original merits further research. Nonetheless, this preliminary study demonstrates that bread was not only an object of consumption in the manuscript’s historical context but was a material whose specific properties made it suited for use in intermediary processes such as impression-making and object-casting within the workshop as well.</span></p>
