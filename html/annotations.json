Their properties, such as hardness, opacity, malleability, and carvability, can also be transformed through the addition of various substances, including resins, earths, and pigments. These versatile materials were used for many purposes in early modern Europe, and also possessed a range of symbolic, sacramental, and other cultural meanings. Taking inspiration from the entry on fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/109r/f/109r/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">109r</span></a> for “Modeling in wax,” this essay provides a preliminary exploration of the broad uses and meanings of these important materials.</p>\n",

         "abstract": "<p>Three entries in Ms. Fr. 640—on fols. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/129r/f/129r/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">129r</span></a>, <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155r/f/155r/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">155r</span></a>, <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/155v/f/155v/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">155v</span></a>—are devoted exclusively to molding and casting roses. This essay clarifies some of the differences between the recipes, and suggests a potential change recorded by the author-practitioner that may have resulted from repeated experiments with the techniques over time. This set of entries are related to the molding and casting of other “thin things,” such as flies' wings, another thin, delicate substance that, like rose petals, necessitated separate castings. This essay proposes that the motives for singling out roses as an object to be molded are likely related to sixteenth-century literary culture in France, perhaps especially in Toulouse, where a literary society known in the sixteenth century as the College de l’Art et Science de Rhétorique awarded cast flowers as prizes for an annual poetry contest, the Jeux Floraux, which originated in the city in the fourteenth century.</p>\n",

Our findings suggest that the author-practitioner knew or speculated about promising properties of oyster shells for making sand molds, but had yet to perfect a procedure for their successful use. In contrast to other more confidently phrased imperatives, such as in “Casting in frames” on fol. 118v, in which the author-practitioner writes in the first person, on fol. 84v he offers no tips, warnings, or reminders that would suggest a hands-on familiarity with the processes.</p>\n",

While casting in sulfur may seem unusual to modern eyes, our experiments show that sulfur, especially in combination with additives such as soot black and “sanguine,” yields results which live up to the author-practitioner’s emphasis on hard, long-lasting and detail-rich casts. Furthermore, they shed light on the author-practitioner’s preoccupation with bubble-like impurities forming in the cast. While Ms. Fr. 640 contains no theorizing about sulfur as alchemical prime matter, we suggest that the material was a metaphor for the process of experimentation itself.</p>\n",

By contrast, most other entries in the manuscript that concern foodstuffs—a relatively small group—give instructions for the cultivation and preservation of fruits and other perishables. Contemporary authors often stressed the hot and drying effects of mustards, and the particular additives used in the author-practitioner’s mustard recipe, namely cinnamon and cloves, were also understood to have such effects. This suggests that the recipe for an “excellent mustard” may relate to the various practical medical recipes peppered throughout the manuscript.</p>\n",

         "abstract": "<p>Throughout BnF Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner attempts to create black oils, stains, varnishes, pigments and—in one recipe—dye. Contextualizing the importance of black in the manuscript and in early modern society, this essay explores a short black dye recipe on fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/38v/f/38v/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">38v</span></a> which uses lead and lye made from quicklime. It then follows the author-practitioner’s instruction to “try other colors with the lye made of lime.” The essay proposes that while this method of dyeing degrades the fibers of wool and hair (and does not work on linens or silks), there is a “material logic” to the author-practitioner’s choice of materials if we place this recipe in context with his other experiments. While there is no substantial discussion of textiles or dyeing in Ms. Fr. 640, textiles make frequent occurrences in recipes as objects of transformation (either to be dyed, or to be used as a source for pigments), as subjects for painters, as tools, as similes, and as the object of useful knowledge. This essay argues that the author-practitioner demonstrates his “textile literacy” throughout the manuscript, including notes on the expense of black textiles, the accounting practices of cloth merchants, and the visual effects of clothing. Given the importance of the woad industry in Toulouse and the economic and cultural value of textiles in the early modern period, such knowledge and interest is understandable, but this essay prompts further questions about how widespread dye experimentation was in this period, the nuanced meaning of color in the region, and even what the author-practitioner might have been wearing as he carried out his experiments.</p>\n",

         "abstract": "<p>Several recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 refer to artistic practices of imitating nature. The author-practitioner appears to distinguish between <em>imiter</em> and <em>contrefaire</em>: to “counterfeit” means to create imitations of raw materials that can adequately stand in for the original. This material mimesis is based on firsthand knowledge of the raw substance and presents an opportunity for inquiry about nature’s own processes of creation. The endeavor to create a manmade equivalent impels the artisan to examine closely the peculiarities of the raw material and to seek practicable techniques that can match (without supplanting) nature’s creative forces. This essay examines and reconstructs the recipe for <em>Jaspe contrefaict</em> (Counterfeit Jasper) on fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">10r</span></a> as a case study and point from which to begin to contextualize the author-practitioner’s interest in imitation. This essay proposes connections between his modes of inquiry into the physical properties of raw nature and important sixteenth-century epistemological projects, including the Kunstkammer and the work of naturalists theorizing about the geological origins of stones.</p>\n",

This category of food appears in the manuscript under three different names: bread, host (<a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37r/f/37r/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">37r</span></a>), and toast (<a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">79v</span></a>, <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123v/f/123v/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">123v</span></a>). The meaning and use of these terms are considered as well as the production of bread and Hosts in the early modern period and the pathways by which bread could have entered the author-practitioner’s workshop. Flour was the key factor in bread production, often selected by availability, preference, and beliefs about particular cereals. The baking practices required for different grains influenced the breads one could bake. Some, such as oatbread, could be baked on the hearth at home; others, such as fine wheat bread, required the high and constant heat of a specialized oven and were chiefly baked professionally. The varieties of flours, breads, and processes show the meaning of “bread” in the period of the manuscript’s compilation cannot be taken for granted.</p>\n",

The author-practitioner likely had some familiarity with plucked-stringed instruments and possessed a curiosity for “invention,” a term he used to describe the automatic spinet and one with broader meaning in the sixteenth century than it has today. An automatic spinet would have belonged within relatively elite social circles, and it shares technical features with musical automata of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. A scaled-down reconstruction questions the likelihood that the author-practitioner ever undertook the entry’s instructions himself. Rather, the “Spinet” entry probably resulted from his interests and encounters, reminding readers that the manuscript should sometimes be seen as a collection of thoughts and observations as well as a practical guidebook.</p>\n",

In this recipe, he provides instructions for drying a particular set of flowers with sand and preserving them in vases of vinegar. Through an examination of the language of the recipe as well as his uses of vinegar, sand, and flowers elsewhere in the manuscript, this essay seeks to highlight the author-practitioner's familiarity with sand and vinegar as preservative materials and postulates that an accumulation of botanical knowledge likely informed his attempt to achieve a more lifelike result. Moreover, his selection of flowers suggests that he was attuned to the cultural meanings of flowers and floral decoration in the late sixteenth century. A reconstruction of the recipe demonstrates that extensive knowledge of the materials is important not only to the outcome but to their handling. The author-practitioner’s vague instructions suggest that he was familiar with the processes of preservation he describes, further underscoring his experience with and interest in preserving organic materials.</p>\n",

         "abstract": "<p>This essay addresses the role of materials not as physical ingredients or tools but as mediators between familiar and unfamiliar processes, taking bread and baking in the manuscript as a case study. References to bread in entries that do not employ this food use the familiar activity of baking to elucidate unfamiliar technical processes, such as when making stucco, to “knead it as if you wanted to make bread” (fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">29r</span></a>). The author-practitioner turns assumed tactile memories in his reader into descriptive devices and implies the primacy of touch in craft practice. Current neuroscientific research argues that touch is the most sensitive of the senses and is strongly linked to memory-making; this might help explain the prominence of tactile descriptions in craft and technical writing. The use of familiar materials and processes as mediators in written accounts enables craftspeople recording procedural and embodied knowledge to bridge the gap between experience and words.</p>\n",

This essay contextualizes the mixture in relation to other wax compounds described in the manuscript and other craft treatises. Reconstructions of the black sulfured compound and two other wax variants were used to test the author-practitioner’s claims about the physical properties and practical uses of black sulfured wax. Only a limited number of these claims could be confirmed. Further work will have to experiment with varying the quantities of ingredients and mixing temperatures. It appears that the “black sulfured wax” was both a variation of the practice—common among early modern artisans—of mixing wax with black additives, and an extension of the author-practitioner’s many experiments with sulfur and wax.</p>\n",

Like some other medical recipes in the manuscript it calls for relatively few ingredients but specifies a complex making process to transform the material into a different state.

In addition, the recipe provides information about its source and trustworthiness. The reconstruction of the recipe revealed the transformation of the mixture of linseed oil and hardening wax, two hydrophobic substances, into a fluffy white ointment through constant stirring with water, and, at the same time, the purifying “ritual” brought about a visible whitening and “inspiriting” of the materials with each recited prayer and washing with holy water.</p>\n",

         "abstract": "<p>Throughout Ms. Fr. 640, the author-practitioner uses <em>azur</em> to refer to blue pigments. It is not immediately clear if he uses <em>azur</em> in its general sense of “blue color” or in reference to specific pigments. Analyzing historical uses of the term <em>azur</em> can provide a sense of the linguistic and artistic landscape in which the author-practitioner operated. The four most likely pigments to which <em>azur</em> could refer are azurite, lapis lazuli, smalt, and verditer (synthetic azurite). In tabulating the textual occurrences of <em>azur</em> to isolate patterns of use, <em>azur</em>, <em>azur desmail</em>, <em>cendres dazur</em>, and <em>azur dacre</em> emerge as significant. Through reconstruction of entries involving <em>azur</em> (fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl\"><span class=\"underline\">11r</span></a>), we found qualitative data to support a tentative historical identification of <em>cendres dazur</em> with verditer. Although <em>azur desmail</em> would seem to denote smalt, we as yet lack experimental justification for such a conclusion. The reconstructions carried out for this essay demonstrate the complexity of blue pigment making and application during the Renaissance, and allow us to draw very tentative conclusions as to the identity of some of the author-practitioner’s terms for blue pigments.</p>\n",

This description at first appears similar to the process of using paper that later became known as papier-mâché. The research on the historical meaning and uses of <em>carton</em> in this essay, and its examination of references to <em>carton</em> in both Ms. Fr. 640 and contemporaneous French literature demonstrates that, while many uses of <em>carton</em> were similar to those of papier-mâché, <em>carton</em> was also employed in ways not associated with papier-mâché. By examining the multiple functions of <em>carton</em>—as a cheaper mold substitute, or as an element in composite decorative objects, for example—this essay sheds light on the capacious understanding of the material in early modern Europe.</p>\n",

Comparison of the recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 with contemporary textual sources gives insight into the variety of uses for aquafortis and the various ingredients for making it. This indicates that the term copperas refers to any sulfate (vitriol), and <em>solle</em> refers to salt (NaCl) rather than saltpeter. The genres of texts containing aquafortis recipes reveal that the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 bear comparison with a variety of literary traditions: alchemical manuscripts, metallurgical treatises, treatises on arts, and books of secrets. Finally, the recipe for aquafortis on fol. 75r was reconstructed, which showed the efficacy of the recipe and its correspondence with contemporary expectations about aquafortis.</p>\n",

The essay surveys the history of tablets, from ancient and medieval wooden tablets inlaid with wax to early modern varieties made of coated paper and parchment for writing and metalpoint drawing. Several contemporary manuscripts feature recipes for a ground that could be applied to different supports, written on with a metal stylus, erased, and reused. As the author-practitioner makes no mention of any ground, the reconstruction examines possible reasons for such an omission. The essay speculates that the author-practitioner may have used a tablet like the one he describes—perhaps an erasable notebook made by an expert in which he could record his observations temporarily before he transferred them to his final manuscript.</p>\n",

It considers similarities and differences between these two works and analyzes areas of overlap. I argue that Plat, for all his emphasis on experiential knowledge, probably had less personal experience of casting, molding, and weapons than the author-practitioner. I explore the local contexts and knowledge networks in which the texts were produced, and how the author-practitioner and Plat dealt with the issue of secrets in their works. This comparison of the two texts highlights the importance of experience and exchange in early modern knowledge networks.</p>\n",

What constitutes a stone and what distinguishes it from other natural resources and usable objects? How does the author-practitioner demonstrate and produce knowledge about stone as a material by exploiting its material properties, and to what end? Analysis suggests five categories to classify the author-practitioner’s understanding and use of stone: tools and supports, materials, matrices, gemstones, and reference materials.

It situates this bread molding recipe in its historical context—of bread molding methods as well as uses of bread and bread making in craft and artistic practices—in the period of the manuscript’s compilation. The reconstruction tests the viability of this process, specifically, the entry’s instructions to dry the bread in order to reduce the size of an impression in a bread mold, and thus of the subsequently cast object, in relation to the original pattern used to make the imprint. Reconstruction shows that the types of bread used, along with the preparation of the bread pith, influence the extent of the shrinkage. Reheating a bread mold also hastened the shrinking process that occurred when imprints were left to dry naturally. The longer the molds were reheated, the more the impressions decreased in size.</p>\n",

The first reconstruction demonstrates that his methods for preparing and pressing wax for imprinting can yield a large seal that was as well formed as one made using an alternative technique involving pouring molten wax. The second reconstruction, which explores additives that give a greater hardness to wax, produced less conclusive results, in part because of uncertainty about how much lead white and how much pigment were to be added to a given quantity of wax.</p>\n",

The technical and artistic “recipes” contained in Ms. Fr. 640 provide an outstanding opportunity to explore the epistemic and historical intersections between craft making and scientific knowing, especially in light of the emergence of a new science in the following centuries. Ms. Fr. 640 provides important insights into the material, technical, and intellectual worlds of late sixteenth-century Europe, and brings a better understanding of how and why nature was investigated, used in art, and collected and appreciated in early modern Europe. It sheds light, as well, on the type of knowledge possessed by handworkers, known today as “practical knowledge,” “how-to,” or “makers’ knowledge.” At the heart of the Edition of Ms. Fr. 640, however, lies an intriguing puzzle: who was the anonymous individual who wrote down (and in many cases tried out) these 930 entries filling 170 folios, and why did a French nobleman collect and preserve this manuscript?</p>\n",

         "abstract": "<p>Ms. Fr. 640 belongs to the Béthune collection in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, and the names of three master artisans living in Paris are mentioned on the first page, thus appearing to connect the text to a Parisian context. Several personal and place names and other clues in the manuscript indicate, however, that it was written by an individual familiar with the Languedoc, who probably lived in Toulouse at the end of the sixteenth century. This essay discusses the activity of Toulouse’s gunners, founders, painters, and goldsmiths to shed light on the political, economic, and artistic context in which the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 wrote. Several entries in the manuscript and the interests of its author-practitioner echo the activities, collaborations, and ambitions of the most prominent craftsmen of the Languedoc capital, such as the goldsmith Masse brothers and the Arsenal metal founder Barthélémy Fraysse.</p>\n<p>L’appartenance du Ms. Fr. 640 à la collection Béthune de la Bibliothèque nationale de France et le fait que les trois maîtres artisans mentionnés sur la première page du manuscrit aient vécu à Paris ont d’abord incité à mener des recherches en direction du contexte parisien. Plusieurs noms de personnes, de lieux et d’autres indications contenus dans le manuscrit indiquent cependant que ce dernier fut écrit par un homme familier du Languedoc, ayant probablement vécu à Toulouse à la fin du XVIe siècle. À travers l’analyse de l’activité des artilleurs, des fondeurs, des peintres et des orfèvres toulousains, cet essai vise à mieux comprendre le contexte politique, économique et artistique dans lequel l’auteur-praticien du Ms. Fr. 640 rédigea ce recueil. Plusieurs recettes du manuscrit et les centres d’intérêt dont témoigne l’auteur-praticien font écho à l’activité, à l’ambition et aux collaborations des artisans les plus importants de la capitale languedocienne, tels que les frères Masse, orfèvres, et Barthélémy Fraysse, fondeur à l’Arsenal.</p>\n",

         "abstract": "<p>A comparison between four manuscripts demonstrates an evolution from the genre of the recipe to the experimental essay. As a notion of general experience slowly transformed into the practice of experimentation at a particular time and place, how-to accounts became increasingly historicized and personalized. In contrast to widespread narratives depicting modern science as a thinning of previously thick, embodied knowledge, this evolution demonstrates knowledge thickening, becoming more personalized and explicit both about material experience and symbolic interpretation. This is apparent in the case of Ms. Fr. 640, in the frequent use of the first-person voice, especially at points in which the author-practitioner was most actively engaged in speculating about and experimenting with new techniques.This long-term evolution of the experimental essay situates the epistemology of making and knowing in relation to previous long-term accounts concerning the scientific method. Previously, the experimental essay has been associated with Restoration experimental philosophy, as it developed out of the works of Sir Francis Bacon. In such accounts, the experimental essay serves as the ideal expression of a particular epistemology. This essay backdates the experimental essay and demonstrates its slow emergence from the genre of the recipe. Showing the experimental essay’s connection with prior genres also suggests experimental philosophy’s connection with previous epistemologies. Neither the experimental essay nor experimental philosophy emerged fully formed in the works of Bacon and his followers. On the slow course of development that produced them, we can situate Ms. Fr. 640 at an important stage of the personalization and historicization of experiment.</p>\n",
