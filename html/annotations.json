This essay\n                clarifies some of the differences between the recipes, and\n                suggests a potential change recorded by the author-practitioner\n                that may have resulted from repeated experiments with the\n                techniques over time. This set of entries are related to the\n                molding and casting of other “thin things,” such as flies'\n                wings, another thin, delicate substance that, like rose petals,\n                necessitated separate castings. This essay proposes that the\n                motives for singling out roses as an object to be molded are\n                likely related to sixteenth-century literary culture in France,\n                perhaps especially in Toulouse, where a literary society known\n                in the sixteenth century as the College de l’Art et Science de\n                Rhétorique awarded cast flowers as prizes for an annual poetry\n                contest, the Jeux Floraux, which originated in the city in the\n                fourteenth century.</p>\n\n        ",

The entries thus very rarely address the\n                fabrication of the original pattern for making the mold. Medals\n                are frequently reproduced or made in serial production in Ms.\n                Fr. 640, but the actual procedure for making that first model is\n                left mostly unmentioned.

         "abstract": "\n            <p>BnF Ms. Fr. 640 features several recipes for making “sand” molds.\n                They usually involve the combination of a dry element with a wet\n                binding agent, often referred to as “<em>magistra</em>.” This\n                essay examines the sand casting technique described on fol. <a href=\"https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl\"><u>84v</u></a>\n                that involves the use of a mixture of calcined and pulverized ox\n                foot bone with elm root boiled in wine. While ox foot bone is\n                referenced in the manuscript as an ideal medium for sand\n                casting, the particular properties of elm root boiled in wine as\n                a binder are less clear. In our reconstruction of the recipe\n                entitled “Sand,” we sought not only to shed light on the\n                ingredients and procedures involved in the preparation of the\n                elm root and wine binder but also to consider the nature and\n                processes by which knowledge is produced in the Making and\n                Knowing laboratory.</p>\n\n        ",

This essay\n                investigates the efficacy of <em>batture</em>, a mixture of\n                strong glue, water, and honey, as well as the role of its\n                various components. Artisanal recipes and our reconstruction\n                experiments suggest that the honey functions to “soften”\n                (<em>adoulcir</em>) the taffeta, that is, allow the primed\n                taffeta to dry flat rather than crease and curl under the effect\n                of the strong glue in the <em>batture</em>. This recipe belongs\n                among those entries in Ms. Fr. 640 that attest to the\n                author-practitioner’s interest in ornamenting fabric and in the\n                production of ephemeral works meant for short-lived, all-weather\n                use, such as banners and pennants.</p>\n\n        ",

It then follows the\n                author-practitioner’s instruction to “try other colors with the\n                lye made of lime.” The essay proposes that while this method of\n                dyeing degrades the fibers of wool and hair (and does not work\n                on linens or silks), there is a “material logic” to the\n                author-practitioner’s choice of materials if we place this\n                recipe in context with his other experiments. While there is no\n                substantial discussion of textiles or dyeing in Ms. Fr. 640,\n                textiles make frequent occurrences in recipes as objects of\n                transformation (either to be dyed, or to be used as a source for\n                pigments), as subjects for painters, as tools, as similes, and\n                as the object of useful knowledge. This essay argues that the\n                author-practitioner demonstrates his “textile literacy”\n                throughout the manuscript, including notes on the expense of\n                black textiles, the accounting practices of cloth merchants, and\n                the visual effects of clothing. Given the importance of the woad\n                industry in Toulouse and the economic and cultural value of\n                textiles in the early modern period, such knowledge and interest\n                is understandable, but this essay prompts further questions\n                about how widespread dye experimentation was in this period, the\n                nuanced meaning of color in the region, and even what the\n                author-practitioner might have been wearing as he carried out\n                his experiments.</p>\n\n        ",

This essay\n                analyzes that entry, contextualizing it in relation to other\n                painting recipes in the manuscript and to other early modern\n                artisanal treatises, before turning to laboratory\n                reconstruction. Ms. Fr. 640 points to the intertwined\n                relationship between representing skin and the body’s shadows,\n                thereby reflecting broader concerns of early modern artistic\n                practice. The author-practitioner also advises altering the hue\n                of flesh shading by gender, which may owe something to humoral\n                theory. Among the pigments he suggests using for male shadows is\n                jet, a substance rarely mentioned in other painting treatises.\n                The results of the reconstructions suggest that the specific\n                paint medium intended by the term “distemper” may have been\n                glue, but this is not conclusive and further experimentation is\n                necessary.</p>\n\n        ",

These tricks are\n                part of a larger canon of “secrets” performed at public places,\n                such as markets and taverns, and transmitted over several\n                centuries and across the globe. Traditionally, conjuring tricks\n                were judged to be deceptive and therefore illicit. Prominent\n                sixteenth-century scholars like Reginald Scot and Agrippa von\n                Nettesheim were determined to debunk such performances as\n                fraudulent. Meanwhile, these feats of practical magic also\n                conveyed early forms of specialist knowledge in mathematics\n                (riddles), physics and astronomy (optical effects), chemistry\n                (transmutation), and theatrical display (mechanical props). This\n                essay examines the social life of sleight of hand in its\n                widespread cultural transmission.

In Ms. Fr. 640,\n                however, the material is almost exclusively mentioned on a\n                single folio (fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46r/f/46r/tl\"><u>46r</u></a>–<a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/46v/f/46v/tl\"><u>v</u></a>)\n                in a series of recipes possibly copied from a source referred to\n                as “Urb.” This essay studies and recreates a selection of these\n                recipes, focusing on those in which oil of sulfur is used as a\n                material for a scribe—as an invisible ink, in creating openwork\n                in paper, as a cleaning agent for quills, and for removing ink\n                from parchment.

         "abstract": "\n            <p>Several recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 refer to artistic practices of\n                imitating nature. The author-practitioner appears to distinguish\n                between <em>imiter</em> and <em>contrefaire</em>: to\n                “counterfeit” means to create imitations of raw materials that\n                can adequately stand in for the original. This material mimesis\n                is based on firsthand knowledge of the raw substance and\n                presents an opportunity for inquiry about nature’s own processes\n                of creation. The endeavor to create a manmade equivalent impels\n                the artisan to examine closely the peculiarities of the raw\n                material and to seek practicable techniques that can match\n                (without supplanting) nature’s creative forces. This essay\n                examines and reconstructs the recipe for <em>Jaspe\n                    contrefaict</em> (Counterfeit Jasper) on fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/10r/f/10r/tl\"><u>10r</u></a>\n                as a case study and point from which to begin to contextualize\n                the author-practitioner’s interest in imitation. This essay\n                proposes connections between his modes of inquiry into the\n                physical properties of raw nature and important\n                sixteenth-century epistemological projects, including the\n                <em>Kunstkammer</em> and the work of naturalists theorizing\n                about the geological origins of stones.</p>\n\n        ",

This category of\n                food appears in the manuscript under three different names:\n                bread, host (<a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37r/f/37r/tl\"><u>37r</u></a>),\n                and toast (<a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl\"><u>79v</u></a>,\n                <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/123v/f/123v/tl\"><u>123v</u></a>).\n                The meaning and use of these terms are considered as well as the\n                production of bread and Hosts in the early modern period and the\n                pathways by which bread could have entered the\n                author-practitioner’s workshop. Flour was the key factor in\n                bread production, often selected by availability, preference,\n                and beliefs about particular cereals. The baking practices\n                required for different grains influenced the breads one could\n                bake. Some, such as oatbread, could be baked on the hearth at\n                home; others, such as fine wheat bread, required the high and\n                constant heat of a specialized oven and were chiefly baked\n                professionally. The varieties of flours, breads, and processes\n                show the meaning of “bread” in the period of the manuscript’s\n                compilation cannot be taken for granted.</p>\n\n        ",

The\n                author-practitioner likely had some familiarity with\n                plucked-stringed instruments and possessed a curiosity for\n                “invention,” a term he used to describe the automatic spinet and\n                one with broader meaning in the sixteenth century than it has\n                today. An automatic spinet would have belonged within relatively\n                elite social circles, and it shares technical features with\n                musical automata of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

This\n                recipe, on fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl\"><u>77r</u></a>,\n                is also the only reference to “oriental medicine” in the\n                manuscript and the sole example of the use of a pipe to make\n                smoke. In other parts of the manuscript, however, the\n                author-practitioner includes numerous references to good and bad\n                smoke, breath, and vapors in the context of bodily health and\n                craft techniques. This essay discusses this recipe's\n                relationship to others in Ms. Fr. 640, offering insights into\n                the author-practitioner’s conceptions of medicinal materials and\n                practices, and the overlap between medical and non-medical\n                processes in the manuscript. To further situate “Medicine of the\n                orientals against all maladies,” this essay explores its\n                possible genealogy within global medicinal practices. These\n                interconnections demonstrate the importance of historicizing\n                artisanal and medical practice and their related knowledge\n                systems.</p>\n\n        ",

In this recipe, he\n                provides instructions for drying a particular set of flowers\n                with sand and preserving them in vases of vinegar. Through an\n                examination of the language of the recipe as well as his uses of\n                vinegar, sand, and flowers elsewhere in the manuscript, this\n                essay seeks to highlight the author-practitioner's familiarity\n                with sand and vinegar as preservative materials and postulates\n                that an accumulation of botanical knowledge likely informed his\n                attempt to achieve a more lifelike result. Moreover, his\n                selection of flowers suggests that he was attuned to the\n                cultural meanings of flowers and floral decoration in the late\n                sixteenth century. A reconstruction of the recipe demonstrates\n                that extensive knowledge of the materials is important not only\n                to the outcome but to their handling. The author-practitioner’s\n                vague instructions suggest that he was familiar with the\n                processes of preservation he describes, further underscoring his\n                experience with and interest in preserving organic materials.\n            </p>\n\n        ",

References to bread in entries that do not\n                employ this food use the familiar activity of baking to\n                elucidate unfamiliar technical processes, such as when making\n                stucco, to “knead it as if you wanted to make bread” (fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl\"><u>29r</u></a>).\n                The author-practitioner turns assumed tactile memories in his\n                reader into descriptive devices and implies the primacy of touch\n                in craft practice. Current neuroscientific research argues that\n                touch is the most sensitive of the senses and is strongly linked\n                to memory-making; this might help explain the prominence of\n                tactile descriptions in craft and technical writing. The use of\n                familiar materials and processes as mediators in written\n                accounts enables craftspeople recording procedural and embodied\n                knowledge to bridge the gap between experience and words.</p>\n\n        ",

It is not clear if this\n                means <em>azur</em> in a general sense of “blue color” or as a\n                reference to specific pigments. Analyzing historical uses of the\n                term <em>azur</em> can give insight into the linguistic and\n                artistic landscape in which the author-practitioner operated.\n                The four most likely pigments to which <em>azur</em> could refer\n                are azurite, lapis lazuli, smalt, and verditer (synthetic\n                azurite). In tabulating textual occurrences of <em>azur</em> to\n                isolate patterns of use, <em>azur</em>, <em>azur desmail</em>,\n                <em>cendres dazur</em>, and <em>azur dacre</em> emerge as\n                significant. Through reconstruction of entries involving\n                <em>azur</em> (fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl\"><u>11r</u></a>),\n                we found qualitative data to support a tentative historical\n                identification of <em>cendres dazur</em> with verditer. Although\n                <em>azur desmail</em> would seem to denote smalt, we as yet lack\n                experimental justification for this conclusion. The\n                reconstructions carried out for this essay demonstrate the\n                complexity of blue pigment making and application during the\n                Renaissance, and allow us to draw very tentative conclusions as\n                to the identity of some of the manuscript’s terms for blue\n                pigments.</p>\n\n        ",

The\n                research on the historical meaning and uses of <em>carton</em>\n                in this essay, and its examination of references to\n                <em>carton</em> in both Ms. Fr. 640 and contemporaneous French\n                literature demonstrates that, while many uses of <em>carton</em>\n                were similar to those of papier-mâché, <em>carton</em> was also\n                employed in ways not associated with papier-mâché.

An historical study of literature\n                thematically similar and contemporaneous to Ms. Fr. 640,\n                followed by a reconstruction of the recipes for <em>Grottes</em>\n                (Grottos) from fols. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/40r/f/40r/tl\"><u>40r</u></a>\n                and <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/118r/f/118r/tl\"><u>118r</u></a>,\n                suggests that the artificial grotto the author-practitioner\n                ornamented was likely intended for a festival.</p>\n\n        ",

Comparison of the recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 with\n                contemporary textual sources gives insight into the variety of\n                uses for aquafortis and the various ingredients for making it.\n                This indicates that the term copperas refers to any sulfate\n                (vitriol), and <em>solle</em> refers to salt (NaCl) rather than\n                saltpeter. The genres of texts containing aquafortis recipes\n                reveal that the recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 bear comparison with a\n                variety of literary traditions: alchemical manuscripts,\n                metallurgical treatises, treatises on arts, and books of\n                secrets. Finally, the recipe for aquafortis on fol. 75r was\n                reconstructed, which showed the efficacy of the recipe and its\n                correspondence with contemporary expectations about aquafortis.\n            </p>\n\n        ",

I draw a distinction between “virtual” and\n                “concrete” modes of investigating the manuscript before arguing\n                that it should be studied using both modes in an interwoven\n                manner. I track the problematic virtual/concrete distinction\n                through some recent scholarship, and I suggest that texts like\n                Ms. Fr. 640, which combine records of craft practice with\n                evidence of engagement in those practices, call for a\n                reevaluation of epistemological categories such as propositional\n                and practical knowledge in order to better understand artisanal\n                ways of knowing.</p>\n\n        ",

This essay\n                starts to fill the lacuna by examining a sixteenth-century\n                recipe, “Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, etc.,”\n                on fol. <a href=\"http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4v/f/4v/tl\"><u>4v</u></a>\n                of Ms. Fr. 640. What was black varnish for armor? How was it\n                made and applied? What ingredients and techniques were used?\n                What purposes did it serve? Using a combination of\n                reconstruction and textual research, this essay suggests that\n                “Black varnish for sword guard” was used as an etching ground, a\n                rust-protection coat, and a finish to impart luster and\n                brilliance to armor and metals. The reconstructions underpinning\n                this essay give insights into the varnish ingredients and show\n                that success (or failure) in making and applying black varnish\n                depended as much on the properties of the ingredients as on an\n                artisan’s knowledge of heat, metals, and tools—as well as the\n                skill of working with them.</p>\n\n        ",

Reconstruction shows\n                that the types of bread used, along with the preparation of the\n                bread pith, influence the extent of the shrinkage. Reheating a\n                bread mold also hastened the shrinking process that occurred\n                when imprints were left to dry naturally. The longer the molds\n                were reheated, the more the impressions decreased in size.</p>\n\n        ",

The technical and artistic\n                “recipes” contained in Ms. Fr. 640 provide an outstanding\n                opportunity to explore the epistemic and historical\n                intersections between craft making and scientific knowing,\n                especially in light of the emergence of a new science in the\n                following centuries. Ms. Fr. 640 provides important insights\n                into the material, technical, and intellectual worlds of late\n                sixteenth-century Europe, and brings a better understanding of\n                how and why nature was investigated, used in art, and collected\n                and appreciated in early modern Europe.

Nevertheless, spaces, places, and their material\nand conceptual contours support the author-practitioner’s activities and\noffer insight into his worldview. This essay attempts to reconstruct\nsomething of the author-practitioner’s workshop, his itineraries in and\nbeyond Toulouse, and his assumptions about environments of creative\nlabor. The first half of the essay considers the space of the\nauthor-practitioner’s workshop, surveying the equipment, tools, and\nmaterials in his workspace and comparing them to the items commonly\nfound in the workshops of contemporary French goldsmiths. The second\nhalf pivots to examine spaces beyond the workshop walls, examining the\nrole of domestic spaces, the urban landscape, the countryside, and the\nwider world in the author-practitioner’s enterprise.</p>\n",

Most\n                period sources, such as guild regulations, court documents,\n                commissions, and inventories, provide only hints about the\n                materials, techniques, cultural experience, and tacit knowledge\n                that clearly once existed. A more vivid picture emerges from Ms.\n                Fr. 640, which is discussed in this essay&nbsp;alongside\n                surviving objects. The essay first addresses the craft of the\n                furbisher or sword cutler discussed over four folios (fols. <a href=\"https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/94r/f/94r/tl\"><u>94r</u></a>–<a href=\"https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/97r/f/97r/tl\"><u>97r</u></a>),\n                and then the use and maintenance of firearms, their projectiles,\n                and plate armor referenced in several entries. Ms. Fr. 640\n                reveals an industry reliant on a myriad of specialized\n                sub-trades,&nbsp;where no single craftsmen can be credited with\n                the finished product and sale of a sword, and a world in which\n                plate armor and heavy cavalry were steadily giving way to\n                advances and standardizations in firearms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n        ",

Plusieurs noms de personnes, de\n                lieux et d’autres indications contenus dans le manuscrit\n                indiquent cependant que ce dernier fut écrit par un homme\n                familier du Languedoc, ayant probablement vécu à Toulouse à la\n                fin du XVIe siècle. À travers l’analyse de l’activité des\n                artilleurs, des fondeurs, des peintres et des orfèvres\n                toulousains, cet essai vise à mieux comprendre le contexte\n                politique, économique et artistique dans lequel\n                l’auteur-praticien du Ms. Fr. 640 rédigea ce recueil. Plusieurs\n                recettes du manuscrit et les centres d’intérêt dont témoigne\n                l’auteur-praticien font écho à l’activité, à l’ambition et aux\n                collaborations des artisans les plus importants de la capitale\n                languedocienne, tels que les frères Masse, orfèvres, et\n                Barthélémy Fraysse, fondeur à l’Arsenal.

         "abstract": "\n            <p>A comparison between four manuscripts demonstrates an evolution\n                from the genre of the recipe to the experimental essay. As a\n                notion of general experience slowly transformed into the\n                practice of experimentation at a particular time and place,\n                how-to accounts became increasingly historicized and\n                personalized. In contrast to widespread narratives depicting\n                modern science as a thinning of previously thick, embodied\n                knowledge, this evolution demonstrates knowledge thickening,\n                becoming more personalized and explicit both about material\n                experience and symbolic interpretation. This is apparent in the\n                case of Ms. Fr. 640, in the frequent use of the first-person\n                voice, especially at points in which the author-practitioner was\n                most actively engaged in speculating about and experimenting\n                with new techniques.This long-term evolution of the experimental\n                essay situates the epistemology of making and knowing in\n                relation to previous long-term accounts concerning the\n                scientific method. Previously, the experimental essay has been\n                associated with Restoration experimental philosophy, as it\n                developed out of the works of Sir Francis Bacon. In such\n                accounts, the experimental essay serves as the ideal expression\n                of a particular epistemology. This essay backdates the\n                experimental essay and demonstrates its slow emergence from the\n                genre of the recipe. Showing the experimental essay’s connection\n                with prior genres also suggests experimental philosophy’s\n                connection with previous epistemologies. Neither the\n                experimental essay nor experimental philosophy emerged fully\n                formed in the works of Bacon and his followers. On the slow\n                course of development that produced them, we can situate Ms. Fr.\n                640 at an important stage of the personalization and\n                historicization of experiment.</p>\n\n        ",

         "abstract": "\n            <p>The discussion of painting in Ms. Fr. 640 forms a relatively\n                small proportion of its content, but one that is significant. In\n                most sixteenth-century compilations and “secrets” books,\n                discussion of painting is largely limited to recipes for\n                materials, often copied from elsewhere. Some, derived from\n                earlier sources for manuscript illumination, describe how to\n                paint particular details such as faces and hair of young people,\n                or animals and birds. Ms. Fr. 640’s author-practitioner\n                describes aspects of Flemish painting practice fairly\n                accurately, perhaps from information received or from\n                observation, and also mentions details of Italian painting\n                practice, relating to painting faces. His account of materials\n                treats their behavior in oil paint, rather than the list and\n                description of individual pigments commonly found in other\n                texts. This emphasis on practical painting in oil for a variety\n                of purposes, including painting decorative metalwork and glass,\n                is unusual in sources of this date, not found in such detail\n                until the seventeenth century. The use of <em>cristallin</em>\n                glass as a drier is described and, more interestingly, its\n                additional ability to give translucency to opaque paint. The\n                attention paid to the blue glass pigment smalt and its\n                properties is unusual: it indicates some difficulties associated\n                with its use, not discussed in other contemporary sources. Other\n                blues, also green, red, yellow, white and black pigments are\n                mentioned, but the author-practitioner’s particular interest is\n                in translucency, which may relate to his interest in cast\n                metalwork.</p>\n\n        ",

Reconstruction has been successfully\n                employed by historians of science, art historians, conservators,\n                experimental archaeologists, and a variety of other groups who\n                each used a particular methodology for addressing questions\n                about history. In the graduate seminars of the Making and\n                Knowing Laboratory, students were guided through several\n                skill-building activities before devising a research project of\n                their own. Research in the laboratory emphasized a careful\n                understanding of historical materials, a focus on the process\n                rather than the outcome of reconstructions, and a synergistic\n                relationship between textual research and laboratory work. I\n                argue that our experimental method can best be understood as\n                exploratory experimentation. Likewise, while the methods\n                developed were specific to reconstruction of entries in Ms. Fr.\n                640, there are many other applications across a broad spectrum\n                of historical research and pedagogy.</p>\n\n        ",

Their flexibility allowed for the\n                adaptation to a number of different uses in various contexts,\n                from specialized workshop notebooks to encyclopedic compendia.\n                This essay compares the author-practitioner of BnF Ms. Fr. 640\n                with a slightly older South German counterpart, Wolfgang\n                Sedelius (1491/92–1562). As a monk and court preacher, Sedelius\n                comes from a different social and intellectual milieu than the\n                anonymous French author-practitioner. Although first and\n                foremost a theologian, he was also broadly interested in\n                mathematics, mechanics, artisanal techniques, chemistry, and\n                medicine. His three surviving recipe collections, compiled over\n                a period of about thirty years, document the personal approach\n                of a scholar interested in a variety of technical and scientific\n                fields. In his later manuscripts Sedelius interviewed and\n                observed expert practitioners and personally experimented\n                himself—approaches similar to that of the author-practitioner of\n                Ms. Fr. 640, although their individual interests and expertises\n                differ.</p>\n\n        ",

         "abstract": "\n            <p>Like blood and gold, salt was a material that brimmed with\n                meaning in late medieval and early modern Europe. As a material\n                metaphor, salt became a way to think about the innate\n                generativity and fertility of nature for authors such as Bernard\n                Palissy or Joseph Du Chesne. Yet I show that the analogy between\n                human wit and nature’s creative power remained absent from Ms.\n                Fr. 640. Here then is the puzzle. If any material in this\n                manuscript book of recipes were a material metaphor, surely it\n                would be salts. Yet ingenuity does not overtly define the\n                manifold roles of salts in Ms. Fr. 640. This striking difference\n                with other books of secrets gives us an analytical thread to\n                pull. How do we get from the experience of salts, as it surfaces\n                in many recipes of the manuscript, to the elaborate ingenuity of\n                salt in contemporary authors such as Palissy or Du Chesne? By\n                contrasting Ms. Fr. 640 with books of secrets that make more of\n                salts, we can probe more finely into how the experience of\n                materials relates to textual tradition in shaping this genre.\n            </p>\n\n        ",

Rather, it was a complex and messy\n                process which required close reading, continuous reflection and\n                alteration, collective expertise, and collaboration between\n                humanists and computers. This essay highlights the flexible,\n                volatile, and non-finite nature of markup, and it illustrates\n                that encoding was not a linear process, but rather was\n                characterized by moving back and forth between pages, constantly\n                implementing new and correcting old markup in an attempt to\n                adhere to new decisions and safeguard consistency. Finally, it\n                shows how solutions to markup problems were frequently sought by\n                considering a user’s perspective. We conclude that encoding Ms.\n                Fr. 640 not only required knowledge but also produced it.</p>\n\n        ",

Several personal and\n                place names and other clues in the manuscript indicate, however,\n                that it was written by an individual familiar with the Languedoc\n                who probably lived in Toulouse at the end of the sixteenth\n                century.

Several entries in the\n                manuscript and the interests of its author-practitioner echo the\n                activities, collaborations, and ambitions of the most prominent\n                craftsmen of the Languedoc capital, such as the goldsmith Masse\n                brothers and the Arsenal metal founder Barthélémy Fraysse.\n                Cliquez ici pour la version française: <a href=\"https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_312_ie_19\"><u>https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_312_ie_19</u></a>.\n            </p>\n\n        ",

However, as scholars\n                have demonstrated recently, this troubled history did not\n                translate into artistic decay. The professional trajectories of\n                artisans from Toulouse, such as Dominique Bertin and Hélie\n                Bachelier, shed light on the context in which Ms. Fr. 640 was\n                written. It allows us to understand how these artisans put their\n                versatile talents at the service of political power, revealing\n                the economic and military benefits of their know-how.

         "abstract": "\n            <p>In sixteenth-century Europe, animals often served as allegorical\n                embodiments of moral principles, while toads and vipers, in\n                particular, were valued primarily for their putative medicinal\n                value. In a marked departure from these conventions, the\n                author-practitioner records his thoughts on capturing,\n                restraining, maintaining, and killing these animals. Although\n                not a natural historian by vocation, in the course of casting\n                amphibians and reptiles from life into objects of art, he\n                amassed considerable knowledge of the habits and characteristics\n                of this often spurned class of animals, especially of vipers.\n                The few people who dealt with these animals—including other\n                artisans, viper catchers, and apothecaries—did not record their\n                observations. In this essay, I survey the author-practitioner’s\n                forays into herpetological husbandry, capture techniques, and\n                methods of euthanasia. I compare these observations with the few\n                other accounts from the time, which do not contain the detail or\n                accuracy found in Ms. Fr. 640.</p>\n\n        ",
