<p><span dir="ltr">There are two entries on oil painting in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 (fols. 10v and 42v) that raise questions about the identity of the materials involved, what it means to paint “without the oil running,” and which—if any—of the alternative instructions can yield proof of concept of this technique. Although these recipes have previously been reconstructed by students from Columbia University</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">and the University of Amsterdam,</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">this essay further explores these questions by using new ingredients in varying combinations to reconstruct the recipes, as advised by 2017 Making and Knowing expert resident maker, Jo Kirby. This essay describes the results of these reconstructions, which are also presented by way of video (<i><span class="underline">Vid. 1</span></i>).</span></p>

<h2 id="for-painting-in-oil-on-taffeta-without-the-oil-running-fol.-10v"><span dir="ltr">“For painting in oil on taffeta without the oil running” (fol. 10v)</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">One needs to make a layer of batture, which is made of strong glue soaked for 24 hours in water then gently brought to boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little honey to soften it, &amp; make it boil all together. And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in oil, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also serve you to make a seat for gold. Alum water also keeps oil from running. (fol. 10v)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Fol. 10v contains no information about ratios or measurements of the ingredients used, therefore I designed six experiments to prepare sizing mixtures by varying amounts of ingredients as detailed in my field notes.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In addition, I painted on each different sizing mixture the same pigment (madder lake) prepared in three different oils: 30% thickened linseed oil, 100% linseed oil, and 30% drying oil. Although linseed oil is the historically more appropriate choice, I also tested drying oil for practical purposes. I chose my starting materials in consultation with Jo Kirby (National Gallery, London, emerita conservator). Following her suggestions, I purchased 100% untreated silk taffeta and prepared batture mixtures with varying ratios of 10% rabbit skin glue (colle forte), raw honey, and 10% potassium aluminum sulfate (water of alum). To begin, I washed and stretched silk taffeta on embroidery hoops. Then I divided the taffeta into different regions to be able to test different conditions. Although fol.10v calls for boiling batture mixtures, I was reluctant to do this because boiling is known to weaken and destroy the structure of skin glue.</span> <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Therefore, half of the mixtures were boiled for three minutes, while the rest were warmed to 40–60 degrees Celsius.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">After applying the test mixture or batture on the taffeta with a brush and allowing the mixture to dry overnight, I painted simple lines, dots and squares on each test region. Immediately after painting on the “test” taffeta, which had no sizing, I noticed that oil spread further beyond the edges of the painted area and formed a halo-shaped oil ring. In addition to oil, paint was also dispersed, but the dispersion area was much smaller than that of the oil. Also, the madder red lake paint seeped deeply into the fabric and formed a deep, dark and opaque red color (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>). This was also the case when I did the same experiment on Bowen and Lu’s unsized taffeta sample,</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">but with their fabric, which is thicker and colored, the oil and paint dispersion was more prominent and easier to see (<i><span class="underline">Fig.3</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>). On the other hand, when I painted on the taffeta treated with one of the batture mixtures, I noticed that the paint did not seep into the fabric, and it formed a lighter and more transparent red color. I also observed that while painting over the batture, the paint brush glided over the surface much more easily. Interestingly, this was the case for all six experimental batture mixtures, some of which contained rabbit skin glue alone (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>). These experiments made it clear what is meant by “oil running” in the recipe, and suggested that 10% rabbit skin glue alone, when paired with 30% thickened linseed or linseed binding oil, may be enough to stop oil paint from running significantly. I noticed that when paint was prepared with 30% drying oil, an oil ring was still formed around painted areas, despite the batture. This finding highlights that in addition to the batture composition, the choice of binding oil is very important to be able to paint on silk without the oil running.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_062_fa_17/1KRUxi7TOpgujQVbC7BGhxguR4oQStZZH.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 1.

When madder red lake paint was applied directly on taffeta in the absence of sizing, I observed a deep, dark red color. The paint soaked completely into the fibers and through to the back side of the fabric (see Fig. 2). I also observed a halo oil ring around painted sections. This oil ring was smaller in A, suggesting that this oil mixture is less runny compared to B and C.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_062_fa_17/1XFBbIW1QmnhXaVQR68vJfGUMTgDt_Vdu.jpg" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 2.

No sizing. Here one can easily see that oil is dispersed and forms a halo around the paint when there is no size on the fabric. It is much easier to observe this dispersion on the thick and coloured taffeta sample like this one. Although oil dispersion was observed on all test conditions, it was much smaller when 100% thickened linseed oil is used. This is expected due to the fact that 100% thickened linseed oil dried faster than other oils. It is important to note that there is also paint dispersion although it is much less than oil dispersion. The paint was completely soaked into the textile and through to the back of the fabric (see Fig. 4).</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_062_fa_17/1KfkkfAr68h97hs26M8CF_E-79vFDyc8i.jpg" alt="fig. 4"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 4.

<p><span dir="ltr">It may require further investigation to ascertain the individual role(s) of honey and water of alum in this recipe. The intention of the use of honey, which is a common plasticizer,</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> may be to make the fabric more supple so that it can move naturally in the open air, but I failed to detect any difference in the softness of the fabric sized with batture mixtures that did or did not contain honey. Similarly, I did not observe a difference between fabrics treated with <em>batture</em> mixtures with or without water of alum, which is traditionally used as a waterproofing sizing ingredient.</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Interestingly, boiling <em>batture</em> did not affect its function; however, the consistency of the mixture became thinner and more liquid, which made it easier to apply <em>batture</em> on taffeta. This would appear to explain why the author-practitioner advised that the <em>batture</em> should be <em>“</em>gently brought to boil so that it is hardly strong.”</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">As detailed in previous reconstructions,</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> the use of taffeta for banners is noted in several early modern sources, including Cennino Cennini’s <em>Il libro dell’arte</em>, which contains a section on how to paint on silk. In that section, Cennini also describes how to paint on both sides of silk: “if the same scene or figure has to be executed on both sides, put the stretcher in the sun with the drawing turned toward the sun, so that it shines through it.”</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Since banners meant to be held aloft are visible from both sides, painting on both sides of taffeta might have been desirable for this purpose. <em>Batture</em> application allows painting on both sides of taffeta by preventing the oil from penetrating the backside of the fabric. This can be clearly seen in my final painting, where the back of the taffeta remained crisp and neat (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i>). For this painting I used venetian red and yellow ocher pigments in 30% thickened linseed binding oil. The taffeta was sized with one of the <em>batture</em> mixtures that I tested before. This <em>batture</em> mixture contained rabbit skin glue and water of alum at a two-to-one ratio and 2% honey. I decided to use this combination because it contained all the ingredients described on fol.10v, and it had resulted in slightly crisper brush lines compared to other mixtures I tested previously.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_062_fa_17/1QRa3bJekwfOVmUmW6lE0rpeqvVXhs4nX.jpg" alt="fig. 6"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 6.

<p><span dir="ltr">My overall understanding of what the author-practitioner meant by “oil running” and how <em>batture</em> may function to stop oil from running is similar to Bowen and Lu and the Amsterdam reconstructions; however, there are some differences between our testing conditions, ingredients and results. In their reconstruction, Bowen and Lu tested different <em>batture</em> mixtures prepared with parchment glue, rabbit skin glue and diluted rabbit skin glue, and they concluded that <em>batture</em> mixture prepared with rabbit skin glue and a few drops of honey was the most successful. However, in their case, though it was absent at the beginning, an oil ring became visible around painted figures after about two weeks. Similarly, <em>batture</em> mixtures prepared in reconstructions by Kisters et al. also failed to completely stop spreading of oil; however, the details of the painted scenes did not seem to be affected by this. Since we all agreed that <em>batture</em> mixture prepared with rabbit skin glue paired with linseed binding oil seemed to be the most successful, the difference between our results might be explained by the different types of taffeta we used. This underlines the importance of the choice of taffeta for successful application of this recipe. Since there is no information on the properties of the taffeta that was used by previous students, it is difficult to make a comparison. The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (OED) describes taffeta as “a fine lustrous silk or similar synthetic fabric with a crisp texture.”</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Additional research done by Bowen and Lu</span> <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">also confirms that the word “taffeta” seems to refer to silk fabric. Therefore I decided to use 100% raw and unbleached silk taffeta; however, since I could not find unbleached silk taffeta, I instead purchased uncolored 100% silk taffeta from testfabrics.com</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">and washed the fabric thoroughly before use to get rid of any remaining bleach. Still, further research on the properties of taffeta that could have been used by the author-practitioner may help better understand this recipe.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In summary, my experiments showed that a <em>batture</em> mixture containing rabbit skin glue functions to prevent oil paint from running by forming a physical layer that prevents oil from seeping into the taffeta. I also noticed that in addition to the <em>batture</em> composition, the choice of the binding oil and the taffeta also play key roles in the success of this method. My experiments with varying amounts of ingredients suggested that using rabbit skin glue at a ratio anywhere between 10% to 6.6 % is enough to stop oil from running. This suggests that careful quantification of ingredients may not be crucial for the success of this recipe. This may explain why the author-practitioner did not see the necessity of providing information about exact ratios or measurements of the ingredients. However, another possibility is that perhaps making <em>batture</em> was common knowledge at that time, and thus the author-practitioner did not go into details of ratios and measurements. This could be a point for further historical research. I also wonder, since there are no notes on the margins of the recipe regarding ingredients and ratios, whether the author-practitioner was only a collector of this recipe.</span></p>

<h2 id="painting-in-oil-on-taffeta-fol.-42v"><span dir="ltr">“Painting in oil on taffeta” (fol. 42v)</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">In order that the oil does not run, make your first layer with honey, alum water, &amp; starch water. (fol. 42v)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Fol. 42v is the second entry in Ms. Fr. 640 that describes how to paint with oil on taffeta without the oil running. Although fol. 10v and fol. 42v share two of the same ingredients, honey and water of alum, the rabbit skin glue in fol.10v is replaced with “starch water” in this recipe. Also, this recipe contains much less detail on how to prepare the sizing layer mixture compared to fol.10v, and it does not contain any information about ratios or measurements of the ingredients. Therefore, I prepared eight sizing layer mixtures by varying amounts of ingredients for my experiments. I chose my starting materials in consultation with Jo Kirby, and based on previous historic research done by students from Columbia University.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Similar to fol.10v, I used raw honey, and 10% potassium aluminum sulfate (water of alum) as my starting solutions. For “starch water,” I prepared and used wheat starch paste as described in my field notes.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">I used the same taffeta as in fol.10v and followed the same experimental steps described above. After applying the test mixture on the taffeta with a brush, and allowing the mixture to dry overnight, I painted on each sizing mixture with the same pigment (madder lake) prepared in three different oils; 30% thickened linseed oil, 100% linseed oil, and 30% drying oil. To my surprise, only one out of eight test mixtures was successful at preventing oil paint from seeping into the taffeta fibers (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 9</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 10</span></i>). This successful mixture contained raw honey and the highest concentration of wheat starch, but it did not contain any water of alum. I noticed that this mixture formed the thickest layer over the surface of taffeta, although it could still be applied to create a smooth surface. Alum water served to dilute the wheat starch in other test mixtures, which is probably why those mixtures were not as effective in stopping oil from running. The wheat starch paste that I prepared contained one part wheat starch in five parts of water. In my opinion, if my starting wheat starch concentration were higher (for instance, one part in four parts of water) adding some water of alum to the mixture could still be effective. The key point seems to be the concentration of the wheat starch. Interestingly, although Bowen and Lu</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">also used the same wheat starch paste in their experiments, they failed to completely stop oil from running. Similar to fol.10v, this finding again highlights the importance of the choice of taffeta for successful application of this recipe.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_062_fa_17/1a0tIVSAuCq-bThjRqL2rciNVyyXEesOt.jpg" alt="fig. 9"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 9.Test number 8, front view, Sumeyye Yar, 2017. See field notes for details of test conditions. Sizing mixture: 2% honey (0.48g), no water of alum, 24mL wheat starch paste (0% final concentration alum). Labeling key: A – red lake prepared with 30% thickened linseed oil, 70% linseed oil; B – red lake prepared with 100% linseed oil; C – red lake prepared with 30% dark drying oil, 70%linseed oil. Sizing mixture in #8 (right hand side) was successful at completely stopping the paint from seeping into the fabric (see back view in Fig. 10.) #7 was also better than #1 through #6 but it was not as good as #8. These results suggest that the higher wheat starch paste concentration is more effective.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_062_fa_17/1s-MYDqgBbeZEsQKYdZikpmqmtNC0XH-1.jpg" alt="fig. 10"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 10.

<p><span dir="ltr">In summary, when the correct concentration of wheat starch paste was used, the mixture prepared according to fol.42v was successful at preventing oil paint from running on taffeta. However, the choice of taffeta is the key to success in this recipe. It is not clear why there are two different recipes in the manuscript for the same purpose, but perhaps having two different recipes for the same purpose was desirable when access to some ingredients was limited due to their availability or cost.</span></p>
