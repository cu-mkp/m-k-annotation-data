<p><span dir="ltr">By the end of the sixteenth century, artificial grottos were an increasingly common feature of formal gardens, especially in Italy. The popularity of this architectural structure is reflected in Ms. Fr. 640’s multiple entries that detail grotto ornamentation: fols. 40r, 110r, and 118r. Yet because historians have most often researched artificial European grottos of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries commissioned by elites, they have considered this garden feature accessible to only the very wealthy.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The presence of recipes detailing the use of relatively inexpensive and lightweight materials to ornament a grotto in Ms. Fr. 640 poses a historical question: for what use was the author-practitioner’s grotto intended?</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In this essay, I argue that Ms. Fr. 640’s use of lightweight materials, such as <em>colle forte</em> (“strong glue,” probably hide glue) to affix grotto ornaments, parchment for fashioning imitation rocks, and ground-up paper and glass to embellish them, suggests a grotto that was likely intended for a festival or celebration. Historical research on this question has led to the discovery that grotto recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 appear to be most closely associated with garden grotto recipes of the early eighteenth century, but these later recipes also differ from those in Ms. Fr. 640 in their use of cement, a typical garden grotto adhesive far more durable than <em>colle forte</em>. The deliberate use of <em>colle forte</em> instead of cement in Ms. Fr. 640’s grotto, despite the presence in the manuscript of a recipe for the latter, suggests the author-practitioner’s grotto was likely ornamented for a temporary event, such as a carnival or a festival, rather than a garden.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The popularity of artificial grottos, both garden grottos and miniature versions, endured through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with recipes appearing in a variety of popular collections, including art manuals, and even in newspapers, some of which were aimed explicitly toward an audience of women and children.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">(<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>) Interestingly, these recipes appear to have a close relationship with the techniques for grotto construction in Ms. Fr. 640.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_063_fa_17/1Sv__2vwvCpqEY_IoBeM9baP17lhf72Tt.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Sv__2vwvCpqEY_IoBeM9baP17lhf72Tt"><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></a>. <em>North Wales Chronicle</em>. “Artificial Grottos &amp; Shell work,” 8 January 1829.

<h2 id="spaces-of-illusion"><span dir="ltr">Spaces of Illusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The first known artificial grotto was constructed for the ducal House of Este in Ferrara in the second half of the fifteenth century, and many more were soon found in other parts of the Italian peninsula. Despite the circulation of architectural treatises prescribing the interior decor of an artificial grotto, no two grottos were alike.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In part because artificial grottos were modeled on natural grottos of antiquity, they often used or imitated materials and motifs found in natural grottos: rugged interior walls laden with protruding stones, jagged rocks covered with moss, glistening shells, branching textured coral, and myriad pebbles.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">They also tried to imitate the irregular interior spaces of caverns, despite the often classical lines of their supporting structures. Many grottos included elaborately designed rusticated fountains to evoke the springs and streams that often flowed through natural caverns.</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">(<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>) Animals also graced these spaces of illusion, if only in stuccoed, bronzed, marbled, fossilized, or glazed form. Imitations of snakes, lizards, frogs and fish made up the typical menagerie found in these grottos, but giraffes, elephants, camels, sheep, bears, rooks, crows, pigeons, owls, tortoises, eels and other sea creatures also decorated the grotto’s interior, bedecked the exterior of the fountain, or could be found inside the fountain’s basin with streams of jetting water cascading off them to brilliantly highlight their surfaces.</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_063_fa_17/15EVNEMuhVNBjJvi3QmmJ0ScW81mxUH0s.jpg" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15EVNEMuhVNBjJvi3QmmJ0ScW81mxUH0s"><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></a>.

<p><span dir="ltr">Artificial grottos made their way to France in 1541. Under the patronage of Francis I (1494–1547), the Italian painter and architect Francesco Primaticcio (1504–1570) oversaw the construction of the first recorded French grotto, <em>Grotte des Pins</em>, at Fontainebleau (1541–1543), modeled on the rusticated <em>mode d’Italie</em>. Others were soon erected at La Bâtie d'Urfé (1551) and Meudon (1552–1560).</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It was not long before the French developed a distinctive style: the Huguenot Bernard Palissy (1510–1589) built the first grotto made of glazed ceramics (1556–1564) for Anne de Montmorency. Nothing remains of this marvel, but Palissy detailed its interior embellishment in his <em>Recepte Véritable</em> (1563): it was a two-story structure; the first floor included a set of glazed columns positioned between six concave niches on each side, with each niche glazed in a different color and material.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">One niche was set with pebbles glazed in the color of jasper, another, covered in shells, was glazed to resemble agate or porphyry.</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The final product was of such beauty and skill that the Queen regent, Catherine de’ Medici (1519–1589), bestowed on Palissy the title <em>Inventeur des rustiques figulines du Roy</em>. Palissy went on to design one more grotto at the Tuileries for the Queen.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Aside from their aesthetic beauty, artificial grottos were also sanctuaries of solitude and reflection, summer retreats from oppressing heat, and sites for lively intellectual exchanges.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">(<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>) Humanist scholars such as Petrarch (1304–1374) and Boccaccio (1313–1375) eulogized the bucolic serenity of Roman grottos as places of refuge, solitude and learning. And their verses spurred later humanists, often in the employ of Italian nobles, to revive these structures in papal gardens and ducal estates.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_063_fa_17/1KHErI3EidVl3Kb7bxbHxoiOL1-s7fXs1.jpg" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KHErI3EidVl3Kb7bxbHxoiOL1-s7fXs1"><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></a>.

<p><span dir="ltr">Perhaps the most intriguing imagery a grotto invoked was that of transformation and regeneration. Natural grottos were thought to be sites of transformative processes, their very walls exuding generative, coagulating waters, metaphorically giving birth to stones.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Often found near lakes and ponds, grottos were also frequented by snakes, lizards and frogs, all of which underwent transformative processes of their own: regenerating a tail, growing new skin, and evolving from a swimming tadpole into a four-legged amphibian. Artificial grottos amplified this imagery, and, through illusionism and imitation of natural grottos, they were viewed as reenacting the transformative processes.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">At a time when humanists and artisans increasingly looked to nature for inspiration and knowledge, some artisans, such as Palissy, believed that nature could be understood by imitating it through art or the work of the human hand. Palissy viewed his experiments with glazes as an above-ground investigation of processes that took place underground. He considered them, as he termed it, an “art of the earth.”</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Ms. Fr. 640 likewise reveals not only an interest in natural materials and processes, but the author-practitioner shows himself to be a keen observer of nature, describing the behavior of animals and the composition of earth and stones. Moreover, as artificial grottos were intended to imitate natural grottos, and the author-practitioner was demonstrably interested in imitations, an artificial grotto formed an appropriate subject for his interests.</span></p>

<h2 id="grottos-for-festivals-and-theater-productions"><span dir="ltr">Grottos for Festivals and Theater Productions</span> </h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Artificial grottos were not only a garden ornament. Scholars have noted their presence in late sixteenth-century festivals and celebrations, including noble marriages.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Festival grottos resembled their garden counterparts in overall design, as their walls were also layered with jagged rocks and showed elaborate shellwork, but instead of adorning a garden, they were built within life-size arches. Often commissioned on short notice, these grottos were presumably not built to last longer than the event for which they were intended. While no less lavish in appearance, the ephemeral nature of these grotto commissions saw artists use lightweight materials in clever and inventive ways.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This is reflected in Ms. Fr. 640’s use of <em>colle forte</em> for binding the ornaments, heated parchment to imitate rock, and ground paper and glass, likely used to sprinkle over the imitation rock for luster and shine. Artificial grottos were also used in theatrical performances as <em>mise en scène</em>, with added mechanical hydraulic displays to heighten the visual effect.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The materials used to ornament a grotto in Ms. Fr. 640, including parchment, paper, and <em>colle forte</em>, suggest the grotto was not intended for a garden, but for a festival, or a celebration. A survey of architectural literature contemporaneous with Ms. Fr. 640 confirms this, detailing instructions for the construction of a garden grotto only partially similar to those found in Ms. Fr. 640, to which we turn to next.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="beyond-ms.-fr.-640"><span dir="ltr">Beyond Ms. Fr. 640</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Literature on grottos roughly contemporaneous with Ms. Fr. 640 shows that the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 could have been familiar with Italian texts or with Italian rusticated grottos. As a basis of comparison, I will focus primarily on recipes on fol. 118r, as, among the six entries related to grottos (found on fols. 40r, 110r, and 118r), fol. 118r contains four separate sections devoted to the ornamentation of an artificial grotto.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Together, the recipes call for some fourteen different ingredients: seashells, crab shells, tufa, charcoal, tin, bronze, looking glass tin, parchment, cork, paper, glass, white coral, branches and various marcasites. Only a few of these materials are found in contemporaneous literature: tufa, seashells, coral, branches and glass.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In the 1553 French edition of <em>De re aedificatoria</em>, originally published in Latin in 1452, Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) writes that pumice, Tibertine stone, and seashells are used to outfit grotto walls.</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Giorgio Vasari, writing in 1550 in Italian, observes tufa, seashells, branches, and glass on grotto walls.</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Finally, the text credited for introducing the Italian rusticated garden grotto to France, Sebastiano Serlio’s <em>L’architettura</em> (1537–1547), originally published in Italian and translated into French in 1545, advises the readers to construct a grotto of antiquity after their own tastes, and that the interior ought to show leaves, flowers, animals, birds, and other fantastically made or painted objects.</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Evidence of the application of those instructions in France can be seen in the remains of a garden grotto constructed sometime in the early seventeenth century near Toulouse. A record of this grotto was written in the nineteenth century, which notes tufa, shells, and mirrors affixed to its walls.</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"> These sixteenth-century sources do not contain instructions similar to those in Ms. Fr. 640 for making the components of artificial grottos. However, several recipes found in an eighteenth-century popular compilation, <em>The Laboratory or School of Arts</em>, translated from German by Godfrey Smith in 1738, similarly instruct the use of ore, seashells, white coral, looking-glass and a variety of rocks.</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">For example, in a section “Of Coral Work,” Smith wrote:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">A Gentleman may with very little expense build a Grotto of Glass Cinders, which may be easily had, Pebbles, or Pieces of large Flint, and embellish it with such counterfeit Coral, pieces of Looking glass, Oister, Muscle and Snail-Shells, Moss, pieces of Chalk, Oar [ore], &amp;c. The cement to bind and Cement them together, you have Direction how to prepare under the Article of Cements.</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">It also includes recipes for cement and imitation coral specifically for the use in a grotto, both of which are strikingly similar to recipes found in Ms. Fr. 640.</span><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">But <em>The</em> <em>Laboratory</em>’s grotto recipe most stands out for its atypical use of the term “ore” to describe tufa.</span><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner similarly uses a curious term to describe tufa, <em>stuf</em>, which he qualifies as “stone made from water.” <em>Stuf</em> is a German term for ore, spelled <em>Stufe</em>.</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It is also a variant of another German term, <em>Stüf</em>, defined as “<em>eine Art kӧrnigen Kalkstein</em>,” a kind of granular limestone, or tufa.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner’s seeming recourse to German terminology when French terms for tufa were readily available is puzzling.</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Indeed, he is familiar with the French term for tufa, <em>tuf</em>, and uses it in another entry (fol. 69r). A possible explanation may be that grotto recipes in both Ms. Fr. 640 and <em>The Laboratory</em> were translations of an earlier German recipe for a grotto. If so, an expanded reprint of <em>The Laboratory</em> (1756) also includes alternative uses for artificial grottos that may shed light on the purpose of a grotto in Ms. Fr. 640.</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="miniature-grottos"><span dir="ltr">Miniature Grottos</span> </h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Like the previous edition of <em>The Laboratory</em> (1738), the expanded version of 1756 begins with instructions for a traditional garden grotto, but includes more detail, with the grotto now boasting a water fountain, marbled pavement, and walls affixed with “amber, pieces of marble, agat, or whatever maybe agreeable to set off, embellish, and add grandeur and beauty to the place.”</span><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Yet the more intriguing aspect of this recipe is the construction and ornamentation of “grottos in miniature” for interior domestic use rather than for a garden. Smith includes two sets of instructions for a miniature grotto to be placed inside either a dining room for “elegant entertainment, or inside a dressing room for some private use, and for admiration” of ladies.</span><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">His instructions are more detailed than for a traditional garden grotto. For the dining room, Smith instructs to place the grotto:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">within the wall in the nature of a beauset, to which the water might be easily conveyed by branches of small pipes. The depth should be of a semicircle, according to the width thereof, and the height proportionate to the room. The sides, and the arch over it, [to] line in imitation of rock-work, either with flint, oar, or lumps of melted glass, of various colours, intermixed with several sorts of moss… [with] little pedestals neatly carved and gilt, fixt at proper distances, in rows round the grotto, to put wine-glasses upon… the rock-work of the grotto being finished,... decorate and beautify it with the choicest of seashells, pieces of looking-glass, coral, spar, crystal and other things, as would add grandeur and luster to the performance.</span><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">By comparison, a grotto for a lady’s dressing room, Smith continues, is “not only to adorn her toilet, but likewise to make it serve instead of a dressing-box.”</span><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">For more effective instruction, he even attaches an illustrated plan with keyed letters, which are to be referred to alongside his written directions (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>):</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_063_fa_17/18NaDmxMBNVIZX55uIyGZpJK_EXiJpSaf.jpg" alt="fig. 4"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18NaDmxMBNVIZX55uIyGZpJK_EXiJpSaf"><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></a>.

The bottom image depicts an ornamented dressing room grotto, with corresponding alphabetized markings (A-N) referring to the textual instructions provided by the author for its construction. The centerpiece of the grotto is a mirror, embellished with heavy shellwork running the length of its top and two sides. The grotto is ornamented by three sculptures, two at the sides of its elevated rectangular base, and one resting atop the mirror. It also includes four drawers for “different uses,” including the storage of “pens,” and “writing-paper.”</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">Yet, according to Smith, miniature grottos could also serve as models on which to practice and experiment before a full-scale grotto is erected in the garden. Immediately before launching into his instructions for a miniature grotto, he cautions his readers “to provide themselves with a good design, before they set about their work,” for “if shells, especially in grottos are not put together or distributed in some order… they will have but little effect.”</span><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Models of all kinds were common in painters' studios, including life-sized mannequins and maquettes. The Italian painter Tintoretto (1518–1594) and the French painter Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665) probably used them. On a visit to the studio of Hague painter Samuel Smits in 1678, the Dutch painter Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627–1678) observed modeled wax miniatures of the scenes Smits wished to compose, including one with grottos:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">In his studio I saw all kinds of boards supporting small, indistinct figures in crude relief. Here was Tiresias, sitting in judgement over Juno and her husband as they argued. There was Pan and Apollo competing to see who was the better musician. Elsewhere, Narcissus was gazing at himself in a crystal–clear spring, enamoured of his own reflection. The little gowns were made of painted white paper. This was first moistened and then folded in a generous and attractive manner. The trees were made from twigs of oak. The ground and grottoes were intelligently constructed of moss and the water was a mirror.</span><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">While the author-practitioner does not provide the dimensions or the purpose of his grotto, his use of lightweight materials, unlikely to weather a winter or inclement weather, such as parchment, paper and <em>colle forte</em>, makes a garden setting unlikely. Instead, Ms. Fr. 640’s grotto was likely proportioned and ornamented to resemble Smith’s miniature grottos. However, as the details of grotto recipes, indeed many recipes, were period specific, the author-practitioner's grotto was probably not for domestic use inside a dining or a dressing room—such practices seem to have been specific to the eighteenth century. Rather, it may have been an experimental model on which to design a larger version, or, more common to the author-practitioner’s context, his grotto was likely ornamented for a festival or celebration.</span><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<h2 id="reconstruction"><span dir="ltr"><br>
<strong>Reconstruction </strong></span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Most of the ingredients the author-practitioner advises to use are lightweight and easy to procure. The three ingredients of particular interest are parchment, <em>colle forte</em>, and ground-up paper, all of which stand out for their exceedingly lightweight qualities. Their inclusion suggests the grotto in Ms. Fr. 640 was likely not intended for a garden. In this reconstruction, only entries using parchment, <em>colle forte</em>, and ground up paper and glass were reconstructed.</span></p>

<h2 id="imitation-rock"><span dir="ltr">Imitation Rock</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">I began the reconstruction with the recipe found on fol. 40r, <em>Grottos</em>, that describes how to make an imitation rock or “a hanging rock.” Fol. 40r includes five entries, all written in the same hand, but not with the same ink. (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>) The author-practitioner switched inks for the latter two entries, <em>Boutons de Vermeilles</em> and <em>Grottos</em>.

<p><span dir="ltr">To fill some “empty space” in a grotto, the author-practitioner advises the reader to “put a piece of thick parchment close to the fire, which shrinks &amp; crumples.” The use of parchment is curious because parchment was not cheap, while tufa rocks, the very material the author-practitioner likely intended to imitate in this entry, abounded in the southern regions of France.</span><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The expense of parchment coupled with the wording of the entry, “to fill some empty space,” suggest that the use of parchment was a last-minute addition to a commission on short-notice, which was typically the case in festivals or celebrations.</span><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Moreover, parchment was much lighter than stone and would not require additional structural support. Light, temporary frames were often constructed for arches housing grottos, which necessitated the use of lightweight decorations.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">I began the reconstruction by using metal tongs to expose a small piece of rectangular parchment (probably calf) to heat generated by a hotplate. I increased the temperature incrementally to a medium heat until the parchment began to contort. The final product assumed a curious twisted shape with one protruding mound, followed by an undulating succession of smaller elevations. (<i><span class="underline">Vid. 1</span></i>) I heated another triangular piece of parchment, smaller in surface area with one thinly elongated side, over a hotplate set to high. Because the second piece of parchment was both thinner and smaller than the previous one, it abruptly folded in, then twisted out, then once more twisted in, and turned slightly out. Once it had finished contorting, I set aside the two pieces to be colored. On touch, both parchment pieces felt strong-bodied, and they proved difficult to bend or break even with the application of force. Evidently, exposure to heat did not weaken them.</span><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">(<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>)</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_063_fa_17/1F9G9RQf2SAc69750ehjfDCxYA__c32xF.jpg" alt="fig. 6"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F9G9RQf2SAc69750ehjfDCxYA__c32xF"><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></a>.

<p><span dir="ltr">The recipe next advises to “paint it with distemper, then in oil.” This I did using two pigments, Bavarian Green Earth and Brown Earth Otranto. Over the course of two days, the pigments were first mixed with heated rabbit skin glue, which made them appear dull both immediately when applied and later when dried. The following day, the pigments were mixed with linseed oil instead of rabbit skin glue. The linseed oil gave the pigments a shine. On drying, the rocks retained the shine from the oil. In appearance, the imitation rocks looked quite the part of rocks; the only mistake was to have chosen Brown Earth pigment instead of gray, a more common rock color.</span><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">(<i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>)</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_063_fa_17/1YHkJKwWmtWVbI1YtGmQx-zZFAfZxJNNm.jpg" alt="fig. 7"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YHkJKwWmtWVbI1YtGmQx-zZFAfZxJNNm"><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></a>.

<p><span dir="ltr">The author-practitioner advises the use of <em>colle forte</em>, or strong glue (probably hide glue), as a binding agent for all interior decorations, including tufa on fols. 110r and 118r. The use of <em>colle forte</em> is curious because later recipes for garden grottos, including those found in Smith’s <em>Laboratory</em> (1738, 1739, 1740, 1750 and 1799),</span><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">recommend cement, which would withstand water and weather better than hide glue; this suggests the grotto recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 was not intended for a garden.</span><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">For my model artificial grotto, I used a wooden frame, which I lined with stretched linen.

<p><span dir="ltr">The tufa rocks arrived in the lab as large rugged lumps.

The use of glass shards for grottos also appears in Vasari: “little bits of old bricks that have been too much baked, and pieces of glass which has run owing to the pans of glass bursting in an overheated furnace” are to be inserted “into the stucco on the wall” and arranged “between them corals and other spoils from the sea.”</span><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">After I had ground seventeenth-century sized paper using a mortar and pestle, and then separately had ground glass, the ashen shavings of the paper mixed with the glistening shards of the glass suggested to me that the author-practitioner intended to sprinkle this mixture on top of rocks, real and imitation, for luster and shine.</span><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 10</span></i> and <i><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></i>)</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_063_fa_17/1bBPps9YDrdtm_4mgUrPkQ8-WAuSiJfmb.jpg" alt="fig. 9"><figcaption><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bBPps9YDrdtm_4mgUrPkQ8-WAuSiJfmb"><span class="underline">Fig. 9</span></a>.

<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span> </h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Although the author-practitioner is not explicit about the purpose of ornamenting his grotto, historical research on garden grottos, later recipes in <em>The Laboratory</em>, as well as the use of parchment and paper, and <em>colle forte</em> as a binding agent, suggest Ms. Fr. 640’s artificial grotto was likely not a garden grotto. The author-practitioner may have used it as a model grotto, as the eighteenth-century <em>The Laboratory</em> indicates, or, most likely, it was ornamented for a festival or celebration.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Indeed, as previously mentioned, scholars have noted the presence of grottos in celebrations and festivals that could last for only days or weeks.</span><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The often brief time from commission to construction for these celebrations required the use of lightweight materials, such as parchment, paper, and <em>colle forte.</em> The successful reconstruction of the grotto recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 proves that lightweight materials are effective substitutes for traditional materials and do not detract from the naturalistic merit of the final product. This strengthens the assertion that the author-practitioner’s grotto was likely meant to be temporary.</span></p>
