<h2 id="introduction"><span dir="ltr">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Like many recipes in Ms. Fr. 640, the entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><span class="underline">66v</span></a>, “For preventing teats from swelling,” has several ambiguities, but this entry in particular reveals the challenges we face today in clarifying such uncertainty. Because it is a medical recipe, a reconstruction cannot test the efficacy of the substance due to safety concerns and ethical considerations; this means that much of the trial that has been so fruitful in other reconstructions is not an option. Moreover, this particular entry is also uncommon among the manuscript's medical recipes, which limits our ability to resolve ambiguity through a textual comparison. Nevertheless, my research shows that even under such constraints, reconstruction and close reading can provide valuable information about an early modern medical treatment.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The first challenge we face is that the purpose of this remedy, expressed in the title, is not entirely clear. The swelling of breasts is one of the ailments that occurs nowhere else in in Ms. Fr. 640. Even though the title directly captures the “symptoms” of the ailment, I am unsure how to interpret it: is it related to specific gendered afflictions in early modern period? Next, the heading suggests that the author-practitioner expanded the initial scope of the recipe. The change in hand in the two lines of the heading indicates that the author-practitioner likely first recorded recipe as a remedy for preventing the swelling of breasts. Later, he added an additional line below the main heading, “or to diminish overly large ones,” a phrase that is even more ambiguous.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The second area for investigation concerns ingredients. Most of the manuscript’s medical recipes have a relatively small number of ingredients, ranging from one to four. This remedy, on the other hand, uses eight different ingredients, including five herbs. In this regard, it can serve as a lens to examine the herbal remedies used in early modern medicine.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Finally, this recipe is the only one in the manuscript that instructs how to make a “plaster.” However, the instructions concerning both fabrication and application are not clearly organized, and it is not clear whether such ingredients as the bread, for example, is part of the plaster or a vehicle of application.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">My research, relying on close reading, exploration of materials, and experimental reconstruction in the modern lab, seeks to clarify some of the recipe’s ambiguities by investigating the following questions: what was the remedy used for? What are the ingredients it refers to? And what was a plaster in the context of this recipe?</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="textual-evidence-early-modern-medicinal-materials"><span dir="ltr">Textual Evidence: Early Modern Medicinal Materials</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Although the names of most of the ingredients in the recipe are familiar, in the early modern period, they may have designated a different species or a special source or preparation. Historical understandings of the medical virtues of herbs can help us identify the plants required for this plaster and may provide further clues to the remedy’s use.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The first ingredient we encounter is bread.</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In her research essay on bread, Emma Le Pouésard reveals the complexity behind this seemingly straightforward substance by discussing three words in Ms. Fr. 640 used to refer to bread: <em>pain</em>, <em>rostie</em> and <em>ostie</em>.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The latter two, which have religious connotations, feature in medical recipes on fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/37v/f/37v/tl"><span class="underline">37v</span></a> and <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl"><span class="underline">79v</span></a> respectively The remedy on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><span class="underline">66v</span></a>, however, is the only medical recipe in the manuscript to use the neutral and secular term <em>pain</em> to denote bread. The difference lies not only in the term but also the application. <em>Pain</em> in this medical recipe is for external use, while <em>rostie</em> and <em>ostie</em> are for ingestion. This suggests the <em>pain</em> required for the recipe on fol. 66v was likely the most common bread available at that time.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The next required ingredient is Venice turpentine or common turpentine, which was made from the resin of larch and pine trees, respectively.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Turpentine was typically used as an astringent and binding material in early modern medical preparations.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The remaining ingredients are all herbal: sumac, <em>prunelle</em>, quince seed, pomegranate flowers and olive leaves. Sumac is a common shrub in Eurasia and the Americas with multiple usages.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> The local species in southern Europe is <em>Rhus coriaria</em>, which grows in stony places and can be found in the mountains and woods of Mediterranean regions. This is likely the species used by the author-practitioner in the recipe. Its medicinal virtues, of both leaves and berries, were acknowledged in the early modern period. But which part did the author-practitioner intend for this recipe? The 1597 <em>Herball Or Generall Historie of Plantes</em> records a remedy that uses sumac leaves in the making of an ointment or plaster to cure gangrenes</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">(necrotic ulcerations of the skin).</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> It thus seems likely that the sumac leaves were the ingredient used in the recipe on fol. 66v.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The <em>prunelle</em>, or “selfe-heale,” is also known as brunell, hookeheale, sicklewort, and carpenter’s herb.</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> The herb grows in the fields of Europe. Among its various species, <em>prunella vulgaris</em> is the most common. It was used as an astringent by early modern physicians, who included it in decoctions for wounds or mouth-related ailments.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Quince and pomegranate were two plants commonly grown in the gardens, vineyards, and orchards of early modern Europe. Quince seeds can “alaieth the sharpness of biting humors” and are “good to be layed upon burnings or scaldings”).</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Pomegranate flowers were also used as an astringent.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Their medical properties were known to be cool and dry, which “are good to put into restraining powders, for the stanching of blood in wounds.”</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Olive trees were also common in Italy, France and Spain. Their branches, leaves and tender buds were described as “cool, dry, and binde.” Olive oil was also used to cure swelling, joint pain, inflammation and burning ulcers.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">This brief survey of the herbs applied in this recipe shows they were all common plants either growing in fields or cultivated in gardens. The general availability of these herbs suggests the remedy was a practical therapeutic that could be easily prepared at home. All of the herbs were considered either cool or dry, or they were used as astringents. They were commonly used in cures for skin afflictions, such as burns, wounds, ulcers, inflammation and swelling. Thus, they appear appropriate for use in a remedy for “preventing teats from swelling” and “diminishing overly large ones,” if we read this affliction as a general swelling of the skin.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="sourcing-of-materials-and-reconstruction"><span dir="ltr">Sourcing of Materials and Reconstruction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Sourcing the materials was the greatest challenge in reconstructing the recipe on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/66v/f/66v/tl"><span class="underline">66v</span></a>. After identifying each ingredient, we started to look for modern equivalents or substitutes. I decided to use whole wheat bread to approximate <em>pain du commun</em>, and I prepared two kinds of turpentines for comparison: larch turpentine and silver fir balsam.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Sourcing the herbs proved most difficult. Olive leaves and <em>prunelle</em> (currently known as “heal-all”) are still used today as herbal teas; I bought them from a New York herbal shop “Flower &amp; Power.” Quince fruit, which contains seeds, is sold at the market. The other three herbs, however, are not currently available from local herbal or food suppliers. I started the sourcing in late April, when the weather in New York City was still cold. Thus the pomegranate flowers were shipped from California. My search for sumac leaves (specifically of <em>Rhus coriaria</em>) in different botanical gardens failed; I settled on a substitute, the <em>Rhus glabra</em>, found in New York’s Morningside Park. Even though it is not the right species, <em>Rhus glabra</em> is also used as an astringent and a material for dye, suggesting it has similar properties to the <em>Rhus coriaria</em>.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">As the the recipe does not specify the amount of each ingredient, I decided to use 50 ml of each turpentine.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">I also used the quince seeds from one fruit, which amounted to about 3 grams, as a baseline reference, and used the same amount of all the herbs. I mixed and ground the herbs in a mortar and then divided them into two batches, one for each kind of turpentine (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>). I prepared the plasters by</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_079_sp_17/undefined" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 1.

The herbs include sumac (<em>rhus glabra</em>), self-heal, quince seeds, pomegranate flowers, and olive leaves (3g each).</span></figcaption></figure></div>

<p><span dir="ltr">pouring the turpentine into a pot and placing it on a hot plate,</span></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">mixing in the ground herbs,</span></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">heating the mixture, constantly stirring with a wooden chopstick, and keeping the temperature around the flash point of the turpentines (larch: 59°C; silver fir balsam: 78°C) (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_079_sp_17/undefined" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 2.

</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span dir="ltr">The recipe does not provide information about the duration of cooking. I thus drew on a nineteenth-century recipe for making a plaster with turpentine, which indicates the turpentine should be “boiled to a plaster-like consistency.”</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> This “plaster-like consistency” revealed itself in the process. The larch turpentine was initially very viscous and hard to pour and stir, while the silver fir turpentine was less viscous and easier to mix with the ground herbs. Nonetheless, after heating to their respective flash points, both turpentines became more fluid, making them easier to stir and mix with other materials. I cooked both plasters for ten minutes and then spread the respective mixtures on two pieces of bread. Since the turpentines become viscous again after cooling, it is better to apply them to the bread while they are still hot (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_079_sp_17/undefined" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 3.

<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Compared to other medicinal materials explored in the Making and Knowing project, such as wax, oil and acid, the herbs underwent relatively little transformation during the reconstruction. In this case, the herbal preparations were incorporated with the other materials rather than transformed into a new state, with the turpentine functioning as a binding agent. The reconstruction helps us approximate the visual appearance of a medicinal plaster, but the textual research on the properties of the various ingredients ultimately shed the most light on this ambiguous recipe on fol 66v.</span></p>
