<p><span dir="ltr"><em>At the time this essay was written (spring 2016), the preliminary Making and Knowing English translation of Ms. Fr. 640 gave the weapon mortier as “mortar.” In 2018, in consultation with collaborators Pascal Brioist and Jonathan Tavares, the Project recognized that although the author-practitioner used the French term</em> mortier<em>,</em> <em>he was in fact describing a gunpowder weapon novel at his time—the</em> petard<em>. Related in form to a mortar, a petard was typically affixed to walls and doors for the purpose of breaching. Petards are thought to have been used for the first time at the siege of Cahors in 1580, and were quite widely used from 1588 onward during the wars of religion.</em></span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"><em>Accordingly, the essay that follows treats the “buckram sausage” in relation to mortars rather than petards, though the sausage’s essential function as a fuse, as described by the author-practitioner, may well have been applicable to either weapon.</em></span></p>

<h2 id="introduction"><span dir="ltr">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Ms. Fr. 640 contains more than twenty entries related to gunpowder weapons.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This essay will focus on the text and image of a recipe that details the making of a “buckram sausage,” a weapon component in the shape of an intestine-like fabric tube to be filled with gunpowder and function as a lengthy fuse for a <em>mortier</em>. This French term is typically translated into English as “mortar,” meaning a short-barreled gun that fires projectiles at short ranges and high angles. Mortars were commonly used in siege warfare in Europe from the late fifteenth century onward, developed and first used by the Ottomans in the 1453 siege of Constantinople,</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Directions for making the buckram sausage are embedded within a larger, untitled entry beginning on fol.</span> <span dir="ltr"><a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><span class="underline">23v</span></a> that focuses on <em>mortiers</em>, here understood to mean “mortars.”</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While the author-practitioner discusses the buckram sausage in relation to <em>mortiers</em> and seems to understand it as an extended fuse to be attached directly to a <em>mortier</em>, slightly later sources show that such gunpowder-filled tubes could have additional functions. An illustration in the 1630 <em>La pyrotechnie</em> of Jean Appier-Hanzelet (1596–1647) shows that larger <em>saulcisses</em> (sausages) could be used against the gunports of fortresses, with one end fed directly into the aperture of the gunport and the other lit from further off (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">There is no indication that the author-practitioner knew of variant sizes and uses for these gunpowder-filled fabric casings.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_053_fa_16/1HcpgxY6YvClPPItkx7QuqwWW6_gonzlf.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 1. “Pour faire des saulcisses à fourrer dans les canonnieres des tour pour les fair saulter,” in in Jean Appier-Hanzelet, La pyrotechnie (Au Pont a Mousson: I. &amp; Gaspard Bernard, 1630), 207.

<p><span dir="ltr">The buckram sausage recipe in Ms. Fr. 640 is notable among the manuscript’s weapon entries for at least two reasons. First, the author-practitioner describes at length the materials and technical procedures involved in the making of the sausage, supplementing the recipe with a drawing that shows not only how the final product should look but also how it will function in connection with the mortar. While there are a number of ambiguities regarding the materials used and the purpose of constructing such a sausage, the combination of the author-practitioner’s step-by-step instructions and visual references makes the buckram sausage recipe one of the very few weapon-making recipes in Ms. Fr. 640 that is feasible for reconstruction. Second, while many of the artillery recipes in the manuscript concern larger-scale metal casting and foundry practices, such as the casting of barrels and cannon balls, the buckram sausage recipe exemplifies the author-practitioner’s interest in accessible and commonplace materials and techniques. In fact, the term “sausage” has a strong domestic connotation; at first glance, one might not associate it with any kind of military device or technology at all.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In my analysis and reconstruction of the buckram sausage as detailed on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><span class="underline">23r</span></a> and <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><span class="underline">23v</span></a>, I examine how the author-practitioner mediates the textual description and the material processes of weapon-making through visual illustration. Using research on the historical artisanal production of weapons in early modern Europe together with hands-on reconstruction, I will explore the possible uses of the buckram sausage on the battlefield and examine how the author-practitioner engages with contemporary military technology in his writing. Addressing these issues helps illuminate the extent to which the author-practitioner may have had personal experience in warfare and hands-on weapon production, as well as the relationship between domestic artisanal techniques and weapon-making practices in early modern Europe.</span></p>

<h2 id="the-buckram-sausage-text-and-image"><span dir="ltr">The Buckram Sausage: Text and Image</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">In Ms. Fr. 640, there are two main clusters of entries for gunpowder weapons. The first cluster can be found under the heading, “On the gunner” on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><span class="underline">17r</span></a>, which covers a wide range of weapons including culverins, <em>bastard</em> culverins, passe-volant, falconet, arquebuses, and muskets. This cluster mainly focuses on the weight and dimensions of weapons, occasionally offering practical information about the strategic use of different artillery pieces in different kinds of battles. Although the materials and composition of metal alloys used to cast artillery are mentioned at times, this cluster of recipes resembles a catalogue of weapons without much detail about the casting techniques and actual procedures of artillery production. The second cluster spans fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21r/f/21r/tl"><span class="underline">21r</span></a> to <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/28r/f/28r/tl"><span class="underline">28r</span></a>. These also contain strategic advice on the use of artillery pieces, giving directions for shooting cannons at night (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21r/f/21r/tl"><span class="underline">21r</span></a>–<a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21v/f/21v/tl"><span class="underline">21v</span></a>) and the defense of a town (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21v/f/21v/tl"><span class="underline">21v</span></a>). However, in contrast to the weapons discussed from fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/17r/f/17r/tl"><span class="underline">17r</span></a> to <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/19r/f/19r/tl"><span class="underline">19r</span></a>, this second group of recipes provides more concrete information on the actual production processes of making gunpowder weapons. For example, the recipe for grenades (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/24r/f/24r/tl"><span class="underline">24r</span></a>) and the recipe for a mortar (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/26r/f/26r/tl"><span class="underline">26r</span></a>) both give highly specific instructions about the materials, techniques, and procedures of weapon making.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While the buckram sausage recipe on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><span class="underline">23r</span></a>–<a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><span class="underline">23v</span></a> is part of the larger recipe for making a mortar, it is almost as long as the mortar section itself. The author-practitioner makes it clear at the beginning of this recipe that the main body of the buckram sausage should be “sewn in such a way that it is like a gut through which a stick as thick as a finger can pass” and stresses how the main body of the sausage should be submersed “lightly” in a mixture of vinegar and spirits after being filled with gunpowder. Then, one has to sew “a long string or cord” onto the main body of the sausage before smearing the whole sausage with turpentine. Finally, one is to attach a piece of turpentine-soaked canvas, which should be “split in the middle,” to the end of the sausage that will be connected to the mortar. In spite of these helpful details about making the sausage, the recipe presents at least three ambiguities in terms of the actual construction of the sausage. First, how long should the sausage be? Second, should one attach the “long string or cord” inside or outside of the sausage? Third, how exactly should one split the turpentine-soaked canvas “in the middle in order to wrap &amp; tie it around” the mortar while also attaching it to the powder-filled fabric tube and the mortar itself?</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The drawing of the buckram sausage on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><span class="underline">23v</span></a> provides crucial visual information that helps to bridge the gap between the textual description and the material processes of the making of the sausage (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>). It not only depicts the appearance of the sausage, but this illustration also offers a number of clues about the sausage’s functions and mechanism as a fuse. The drawing of the buckram sausage appears next to the main text of the entry, and it is rendered as an elongated form that occupies almost two-thirds of the left margin. While the image does not reveal what the actual length of the sausage should be, it helps the reader to visualize the proportions of its three major components, i.e., the “long string or cord,” the turpentine-soaked canvas split in the middle, and the main body of the sausage (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>). However, while the “long string or cord” in the image is significantly longer than the main body of the sausage, it is hardly “two times longer” than the main body of the sausage, as specified in the text of the recipe. The visual emphasis placed on the sausage body, as opposed to the long string, may indicate that the sausage body is what is intended to be burnt, whereas the long string perhaps serves to make it more convenient for soldiers to hold the sausage when lighting it and is of lesser importance.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_053_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDQmttcXJwdmQ1bWc.jpg" alt="fig. 2"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 2.

Labels added by Sau-yi Fong.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">More importantly, the image indicates how the three components should be positioned and connected with one another. Upon closer examination of the middle section of the image, one notices that the lower end of the main body of the sausage is closed securely to contain the gunpowder, which is not mentioned in the text of the recipe. Moreover, the “long string or cord” in the drawing is slightly detached from the main body of the sausage in the upper part of the sausage (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>). This shows how the “long string or cord” should be attached outside of the main body of the sausage and, as indicated in the text of the recipe, that it should not be tied too tightly to the sausage.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_053_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDOThnRkhYekxGc0U.jpg" alt="fig. 4"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 4.

<p><span dir="ltr">With this image, the author-practitioner also indicates how one end of the sausage should be left open by drawing a few strokes above the upper end of the sausage to represent a spark from the gunpowder filling of the sausage (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>). Additionally, the tiny hatchings that resemble zigzags in the drawing show how the turpentine-soaked canvas should be sewn, or “tightly” attached, to the end of the sausage that is to be connected to the mortar for firing, as indicated in the entry text.</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This piece of turpentine-soaked canvas is represented in the image with a split at its end and a line drawn down the middle of it (Fig. 3). While it appears that the line drawn in the middle of the turpentine-soaked canvas is separate from the split, closer examination reveals that the two are actually connected to each other by a faded line (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i> and <i><span class="underline">Fig. 7</span></i>). This indicates that the turpentine-soaked canvas has to be cut deeply in the middle so that the canvas can be divided into two strips. By doing so, one could perhaps fasten or wrap the turpentine-soaked canvas strips around the mortar barrel, as described in the recipe text, thus connecting the open end of the gunpowder-filled sausage to the mortar at the touch-hole (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 8</span></i> and <i><span class="underline">Fig. 9</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_053_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDNjVyN1pyS3hwS0k.jpg" alt="fig. 5"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 5.

<h2 id="images-related-to-gunpowder-weapons-in-ms.-fr.-640"><span dir="ltr">Images Related to Gunpowder Weapons in Ms. Fr. 640</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">There are ten artillery entries in the manuscript that contain visual illustrations of gunpowder weapons or the tools to make them.</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Five of these entries concern the size, range, and/or weight of different types of cannonballs. All of the images attached to these cannonball entries are simple circles drawn in various sizes with the aid of a compass, and they do not reveal any information about the actual production processes of cannonballs or the making of gunpowder. By contrast, the two entries related to the use and the construction of an arquebus on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45r/f/45r/tl"><span class="underline">45r</span></a> and <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/45v/f/45v/tl"><span class="underline">45v</span></a> consist of images that outline its shape and detail the making of its cartridge.

Here, all images are marked with letters A to H, which correspond to the textual description of the arquebus cartridge.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_053_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDTFhXVlJHRG5DRzQ.png" alt="fig. 10"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 10.

<p><span dir="ltr">Two other sets of illustrations depict the shape, the use, or the production of mortars in addition to those found on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><span class="underline">23r</span></a>–<a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><span class="underline">23v</span></a>. One of them is a small, simple image in the lower left margin of fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/26r/f/26r/tl"><span class="underline">26r</span></a>, which illustrates a mortar barrel with its muzzle facing upwards (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 11</span></i>). Another set of images is attached to a long entry on mortars that spans fols. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/167r/f/167r/tl"><span class="underline">167r</span></a> to <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/168v/f/168v/tl"><span class="underline">168v</span></a>. This entry, however, does not mention the making or use of the buckram sausage. It contains fifteen images depicting the tools for making mortars as well as the various devices for affixing a mortar to a door or a wall (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 12</span></i>). Altogether, these various images occupy the upper half of fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/167r/f/167r/tl"><span class="underline">167r</span></a>.

<p><span dir="ltr">Compared to the images discussed above, the author-practitioner’s illustration of the buckram sausage stands out in terms of its complexity. This illustration contains subtle details that reveal crucial information about the construction of the sausage not mentioned in the text of the recipe. However, compared to the images of mortar devices on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/167r/f/167r/tl"><span class="underline">167r</span></a>, the various components of the sausage are depicted in a less systematic way. No label is added to help the reader identify the different parts of the sausage or to explicate how the image should be read against the text. Moreover, as I have shown earlier, the illustration of the sausage is at times inconsistent with the recipe’s textual description. Drawn with lines that are less solid and less certain, the image of the sausage suggests that the author-practitioner struggled to visually articulate the material processes of making the sausage.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="mortars-in-ms.-fr.-640"><span dir="ltr">Mortars in Ms. Fr. 640</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Among the five recipes that touch upon the use and construction of mortars in the manuscript, the author-practitioner calls attention to at least two types of mortar that can be used for both offensive and defensive military operations. The first type has its muzzle facing upwards. Fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><span class="underline">23r</span></a> describes in detail a specific kind of mortar that is cast with four handles around the muzzle, and is for “putting below an undermined tower with the muzzle pointing up,” or for “putting in breaches” to destroy the enemy’s fortification during siege warfare. The author-practitioner also adds a drawing to the text of this recipe, which shows a mortar with its opening facing upwards. In this drawing, a stick is shown passing through the ring of one of the handles so that the mortar can be carried by men on the battlefield (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 13</span></i>). The author-practitioner’s representation of the mortar muzzle as facing upwards corresponds with a German illustration of mortars found in Leonhart Fronsperger’s <em>Kriegßbuch</em>, <em>Ander Theyl</em>, dated 1573 (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 14</span></i>). In Fronsperger’s illustration, one mortar has its opening facing almost vertically toward the top, while another mortar is set at a high angle. A cannoneer is portrayed holding a long match pole and ready for firing in the background.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_053_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDYXBidTlndTFJYlU.jpg" alt="fig. 13"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 13.

<p><span dir="ltr">The second type of mortar is one which is affixed to a door, window, or gate and has its muzzle facing horizontally towards these defenses. This type of mortar, which seems to resemble a petard in function, is also mentioned on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23v/f/23v/tl"><span class="underline">23v</span></a>, where the author-practitioner points out that a mortar which weighs forty or fifty lbs. is adequate to blow off doors or iron gates. Under the heading “<em>Mortiers</em>” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/167r/f/167r/tl"><span class="underline">167r</span></a>), the author-practitioner uses a drawing captioned “<em>mortier</em> with ear, placed with its peg” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/168v/f/168v/tl"><span class="underline">168v</span></a>, caption G) to describe a particular type that is used to blow off a door (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 15</span></i>).

<h2 id="the-buckram-sausage-in-context"><span dir="ltr">The Buckram Sausage in Context</span> </h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The textual and visual evidence from Ms. Fr. 640 shows that the buckram sausage most likely served as the fuse. Once the sausage body is ignited, the spark at the open end of the gunpowder-filled sausage will in turn ignite the mortar. The author-practitioner, however, does not tell us directly why such an extended fuse is needed for the firing of mortars in the first place. Neither does he explain in the recipe why the sausage has to be dipped in a mixture of spirits and vinegar, and then smeared with turpentine.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">A consideration of the firing mechanism of artillery pieces prevalent in sixteenth-century Europe can help contextualize the possible uses of the buckram sausage in actual battle, as well as place the manuscript’s text and images in a tradition of constructing and using explosive weapons. Literature on the history of gunpowder weapons shows that the matchlock firing mechanism, which was predominant from the mid fifteenth to the early eighteenth century, is closely associated with the use of a “slow match.” According to the research of Kenneth Chase and Stuart Reid, a “slow match,” or “match cord,” is a slow-burning cotton fuse that is put into the touch-hole of the gun barrel to ignite the priming powder inside the gun, which will in turn ignite the main charge of the gun that propels the projectile.</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The match has to burn stably and slowly so that it will be ready for use anytime on the battlefield. Reid identifies several problems that often occur in the use of a slow match. First, the cotton-made match is vulnerable to rain and humidity—it does not ignite when it becomes wet. Second, the slow-burning match may cause accidents when a soldier carrying the match is not attentive to the presence of gunpowder. Third, the smoke and the smell generated by the glowing match may expose the troop’s location.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Concern about the fire and water resistance of match cords in particular can be found in Robert Norton’s <em>The Gvnner Shewing The Whole Practise Of Artillery</em> (1628). Under the heading “To make match that will resist fire and water,” Norton offers a recipe that specifies that a “cotton bobbin match as bigge as your little finger” should be put into a mixture of liquid that is made up of one part of sulfur, a half part of camphor, one part of “fine mealed quick Lyme,” together with “so much Lynseed oyle, oyle of Petre, a little Vernish liquid.”</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">While the author-practitioner does not speak of a slow match or a match cord anywhere in the manuscript, in his recipe for grenade production on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/24r/f/24r/tl"><span class="underline">24r</span></a>, he mentions the making of a “pipe [...] which can enter into the hole &amp; enter into the middle of the grenade.” More importantly, he describes in this recipe how to “temper” the powder for the pipe with the use of spirits or vinegar in order to “slow” the powder. Specifically, one has to make sure that the powder “will be slow enough to allow leisure to throw the grenade without danger.” Although the structure of a mortar is significantly different from that of a grenade, the short-barreled construction as well as the upward-facing muzzle of the mortar makes it necessary for soldiers to keep a distance from the mortar muzzle when firing it. The buckram sausage, which serves as a lengthy fuse, will help keep the soldiers from injury by the explosive power of the cannonball and the recoil of the mortar upon firing.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In fact, the buckram sausage recipe ends with explicit considerations of safety and efficacy. It notes that the gunner “who holds the end of the sausage” should “give fire, having gotten himself to safety, &amp; the others also.” It also hints at the importance of keeping the sausage dry, specifying that “if there was water in the ditch, one would need to support the sausage with forks.” My reconstruction of the buckram sausage was designed to examine whether the author-practitioner’s call for the use of specific materials, especially spirits, vinegar, and turpentine, could have had an impact on the water resistance of the sausage or the pace and stability of the burning of the sausage.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="reconstructing-the-buckram-sausage"><span dir="ltr">Reconstructing the Buckram Sausage</span></h2>
<h2 id="materials-buckram"><span dir="ltr"><strong>Materials: “Buckram”</strong></span> </h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The sausage recipe is the only place the term “buckram” appears in the manuscript. The French <em>bouquaran</em> is probably synonymous with <em>boquerant</em> (i.e., <em>bougran</em> in modern French).</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> <em>Bougran</em> corresponds to “buckram” in modern English. The etymology of the Oxford English Dictionary shows that “bokeram,” “bukeram,” or “buckram” may refer to fine linen or cotton fabric, or a kind of coarse linen or cloth that was stiffened with gum and paste in the fifteenth and sixteenth century. “Buckram” in its modern sense is a stiffened cloth that is used for bookbinding, usually being stiffened by soaking in pyroxylin to make sure that there is no gap between the fibres.</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Donald King associates “buckram” with the Central Asian city Bokhara (today Bukhara in Uzbekistan), suggesting the term “buckram” originates in the city’s name.</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The entry on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/23r/f/23r/tl"><span class="underline">23r</span></a> does not clarify the weight or texture of “buckram” that should be used to contain gunpowder in the making of the sausage. In fact, the term <em>bouquaran</em> is used interchangeably with <em>toile</em> by the author-practitioner throughout the recipe. <em>Toile</em> may mean canvas, as taken up in the English translation of the manuscript, or linen cloth, according to the 1611 French-English dictionary compiled by Randle Cotgrave.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">For the purpose of my reconstruction, I used unbleached linen canvas instead of the modern buckram used in bookbinding so as to prevent the experiment from being affected by the presence of nitrocellulose that is used for producing modern buckram. Since the author-practitioner refers to <em>bouquaran</em> as <em>toile</em> in the recipe, it is more likely that <em>bouquaran</em> is made up of linen than cotton. However, there is not enough evidence to determine conclusively whether the term <em>bouquaran</em> implies linen or cotton, whether it refers to fine or coarse fabric, and whether the fabric had been stiffened or not. As I will show below, <em>bouquaran</em> presents one of the most important variables for the reconstruction of this recipe.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="materials-powder"><span dir="ltr">Materials: “Powder”</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Earlier literature on the history of gunpowder indicates that large-grained powder was used for larger artillery pieces, such as cannons, in early modern Europe while finer powder was used for smaller arms, such as handguns.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Historian Jack Kelly and others argue that the “corning” of gunpowder was already in practice after the fifteenth century.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">During the “corning” of gunpowder, liquids, often spirits, were added to a mixture of sulfur, saltpeter, and charcoal to form a damp gunpowder paste, which would then be formed into gunpowder of different grain sizes by hand or by sieving after the paste had dried.</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In particular, Robert E. Krebs points out that coarser gunpowder particles in early modern Europe were the size of corn or wheat grains—hence, “corned” powder.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In the manuscript, the author-practitioner mentions the use of “grain powder” in his recipe for a mortar on fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/167r/f/167r/tl"><span class="underline">167r</span></a>, which indicates that he has at least some knowledge of the “corning” of gunpowder at his time. For the sake of safety and convenience, I used short-grain Japanese rice as a replacement for gunpowder in my reconstruction.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="materials-eau-de-vie"><span dir="ltr">Materials: “Eau-de-vie”</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Rod Phillips’ recent study of the history of French wine suggests that eau-de-vie (<em>eau de vie</em>), which literally means “water of life,” was produced by winemakers who distilled wine that could not be sold due to occasional oversupply in the market in sixteenth-century France.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">According to scholarship by Leah DeVun, the French alchemist John of Rupescissa wrote about making strong alcohol from multiple distillations of wine already in the fourteenth century in his recipes for alcohol-based medicines.</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In her essay on the use of <em>eau de vie</em> in the recipes for dragon’s blood, Marianne Nuij argues that the author-practitioner distinguishes different qualities of <em>eau de vie</em> throughout the manuscript, such as “the best eau-de-vie” and ordinary <em>eau de vie</em>, where the better <em>eau de vie</em> refers to the one that has gone through more distillations and thus has a higher alcohol content. She also suggests that an alcohol content as high as 95% could be achieved through fractional distillation.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Since the <em>eau de vie</em> mentioned in the sausage recipe appears to be an ordinary one, for my reconstruction I used “Rodell Napoleon” brandy, which has an alcohol content of 40% and is made from distilled wine.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="observations-sewing"><span dir="ltr">Observations: Sewing</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">Following the instructions of the recipe, I sewed two sides of a piece of canvas together to form a tube and filled it with short-grain Japanese rice.</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The tightly woven linen canvas I used for the reconstruction held the grains of rice very well, even though I only sewed with simple, straight, running stitches that did not overlap, and I did not make a backstitch to reinforce the seam. However, while the recipe specifies that one should use “buckram selvage” for sewing, I did not create a selvage for the edges of the canvas that would have prevented the fabric from unraveling after cutting it. Therefore, the canvas edges appeared to be fraying as I sewed (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 16</span></i>). After making the tube, I stitched another piece of canvas the size of my palm onto the open end of the sausage, which I then cut in the middle. However, since the canvas was the size of my palm and was roughly square in shape, it did not correspond with the more slender piece of canvas shown in the image of the recipe, which seems to be cut deeply in the middle and split into two longer strips so that they can be wrapped around a mortar (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 17</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_053_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDZXFzV1JEaV9nSkk.jpg" alt="fig. 16"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 16.

<h2 id="observations-burning-tests"><span dir="ltr">Observations: Burning tests</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">For the burning experiment, I prepared three strips of plain canvas and three strips of canvas soaked in vinegar and brandy then smeared in turpentine (hereafter referred to as “VBT canvas”) to compare how the two kinds of canvas would perform after being set on fire. Four days prior to the experiment, I soaked the three canvas strips in a mixture of 50 ml Rodell Napoleon brandy and 100 ml red wine vinegar of about 5% acetic acid. After leaving the canvas strips to dry for two days, I coated the strips with turpentine made from the distillation of resin from Georgia pine trees. Then I left the turpentine-smeared canvas strips to dry for another two days before conducting the burning tests.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">I undertook four trials because it turned out to be much more difficult than I had expected to simply keep a small piece of canvas burning in the heavy airflow of a fume hood. The windiness of the fume hood often made the canvas extinguish very quickly. I needed to put the canvas back into the flame multiple times to sustain the burning process. It also helped to hold the canvas strip steadily and horizontally instead of vertically.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">I tried to reduce the variables of the experiment to a minimum in my fourth trial, where I held the canvas strips horizontally and did not put the strips back into the source of fire again after lighting them. The VBT canvas performed better than the plain canvas in terms of sustaining the burning process. For the plain canvas, I had to keep the strip in the flame for forty-eight seconds to make sure that it burnt stably and properly. After being removed from the source of fire, however, the plain canvas strip only kept burning for sixteen more seconds before extinguishing itself and leaving two-thirds of itself unburned. For the VBT canvas, I removed the strip from the flame after twenty-three seconds and the strip kept burning for thirty-eight seconds more. Only one quarter of the strip was left unburned at the end of the trial.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<h2 id="observations-water-resistance-tests"><span dir="ltr">Observations: Water resistance tests</span></h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">I conducted two experiments to compare how the two types of canvas performed in repelling water. In the first experiment (the “drop test”), I put one drop of water on a plain canvas strip as well as on a VBT canvas strip. Then, I observed whether the surface of the two types of canvas absorbed the water differently. After that, I turned the two strips over and looked at the back of the canvas to assess the level of water penetration. In the second experiment (the “dip test”), I first weighed the two kinds of canvas strips. Then, I dipped the whole piece of both kinds of canvas into water at the same time and took them out after about 2 seconds. I weighed them again while they were wet to estimate how much water they had absorbed. After leaving them to dry for 15 minutes, I weighed them again.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Contrary to my expectation, the plain canvas performed considerably better than the VBT canvas in the “drop test” in terms of its ability to resist penetration by a small quantity of water. The plain canvas absorbed the drop of water noticeably more slowly than the VBT canvas, and the absorbed water remained concentrated on a smaller spot on the surface of the plain canvas. By contrast, the VBT canvas absorbed the drop of water very quickly, and the absorbed water spread out more widely across the canvas surface (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 18</span></i>). However, the VBT canvas dried much more quickly than the plain canvas (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 19</span></i>).</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_053_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDLUpzcjJsWEgyOW8.jpg" alt="fig. 18"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 18. Drop test, obverse view. Sau-yi Fong, Making and Knowing Lab, 2016. A drop of water placed on the obverse of the canvas strips was absorbed by the VBT canvas (right) very quickly, spreading across the canvas surface. The plain canvas (left) absorbed the drop of water noticeably more slowly, and the absorbed water was concentrated on a smaller spot on the canvas surface.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_053_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDdldwYnl0eFJXYmM.jpg" alt="fig. 19"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 19. Drop test, reverse view. Sau-yi Fong, Making and Knowing Lab, 2016. Approximately a minute after applying a drop of water to the obverse, the reverse of the VBT canvas (right) appeared to be almost dry and the plain canvas (left) showed a water spot.</span></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span dir="ltr">In the “dip test,” I compared the weight of the two types of canvas strips before and after dipping them into water to measure the level of water absorption more precisely. The VBT canvas absorbed more water than the plain canvas, which is shown by the fact that it gained more weight than the plain canvas after being dipped in the water. The VBT canvas appeared to have lost more weight than the plain canvas after drying for 15 minutes. However, when we calculate in terms of percentage, the VBT canvas only lost 43% of the weight it had gained after dipping, as compared to 58% for the plain canvas, which means that the VBT canvas actually did not dry faster than the plain canvas when it had to deal with a larger quantity of water. Moreover, even after drying for 15 minutes, the VBT canvas had gained 0.125g over its original weight, which amounted to an additional 96% of its original weight. By contrast, the plain canvas only gained 0.055g at the end of the experiment, which amounted to 40% of its original weight.</span></p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><span dir="ltr"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span> </h2>
<p><span dir="ltr">The results of my experiments raise a host of significant questions regarding the materials and the functions of the buckram sausage. Does the use of vinegar, brandy, and turpentine help sustain the burning of the sausage rather than enhance its level of water resistance? Is it more important for the sausage to dry quickly after being exposed to rain than to resist water in the first place? How would the gunpowder filling interact with the VBT canvas to make the sausage work? Is canvas the right material to use? Finally, is it possible to reconstruct the use of a military device under the controlled environment of a laboratory, without reproducing the contingencies of warfare?</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The development of early modern military technology and weapon-making practices in Europe has been associated with the proliferation of arsenals and gun foundries from the fifteenth century onward. Pamela Long has identified early modern arsenals as one of the “trading zones” where practical and textual knowledge was communicated and exchanged among the skilled practitioners and the learned elites.</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">She also calls our attention to how such reciprocal communication between the skilled and the learned tended to take place within sites where large-scale state and/or capital investment was involved.</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This essay shows that the translation from practical to textual knowledge and vice versa is never straightforward, as the material processes are difficult to fully express in text or even with visual aids. Moreover, this study demonstrates how contingencies on the battlefield, rather than the institutional settings of large-scale, capital-intensive establishments, inform the author-practitioner’s conception of how an efficacious military device should be made. The buckram sausage recipe shows that the author-practitioner is sensitive to the conditions of the battlefield—the ditch, the water, the fortification of the enemy, the timing of firing, and the safety of the soldiers. If the battlefield also constitutes a “trading zone” where both material production and knowledge exchange take place, the sausage recipe reminds us that what is traded is not only specialized military expertise bounded by the established practices of arsenals but also commonplace techniques and the experiences of war that helped to harness the explosive qualities of gunpowder amid wartime contingencies.</span></p>
