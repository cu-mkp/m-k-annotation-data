<p><span dir="ltr">Reconstructing the entry “Pounced design for scratching satin” (fol. <a href="http://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/42v/f/42v/tl"><span class="underline">42v</span></a>)</span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">presented an opportunity to develop a clearer understanding of what the author-practitioner meant by the term “scratching satin,” or <em>esgratigner sur le satin</em>. Based on the language of the recipe, it was unclear whether the penknife or piece of glass was intended to cut entirely through the satin or to scratch a line onto the surface of the satin by cutting through some (but not all) of the threads. My reconstruction suggested that both interpretations create a design on the satin fabric (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 2</span></i>). However, researching the terms like <em>esgratigner sur le satin</em>, <em>esgratigner le satin</em>, and <em>satin esgratigne</em> revealed that the word <em>esgratigner</em> or “scratch” was commonly used in relation to satin to describe tearing small rips in the fabric, a technique known in English at the time as pinking satin (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>). For example, a seventeenth-century French–Italian dictionary specifically translates <em>esgratigner</em> when used in the phrase <em>esgratigner le satin</em> to <em>squarciare</em> in Italian, meaning to rip or to tear.</span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Garments made with satin slashed in this way were very popular at the time (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>, <i><span class="underline">Fig. 5</span></i>). Based on this interpretation, my reconstruction of this pinked satin technique demonstrated that the egg white and fig milk mixture which is painted over the pounced design serves as a reinforcement.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The cuts I made on the lines painted with the mixture were much cleaner than those I made on portions of the fabric that had not been painted with the mixture. The cut threads did not fray as much (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 6</span></i>). It is unclear how common the use of reinforcements for pinked satin were at the time, and further research situating this recipe within its larger context would be very valuable.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_078_fa_18/1d53v2i_hyowqKJHjnFU5rlN5tlfpth3_.jpg" alt="fig. 1"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 1.

Because fig tree milk is also a type of natural tree latex, I decided that the make-up latex would be similar enough to work as a proof of concept for the fig tree milk. Further testing ought to be done, however, using actual fig tree milk to reinforce my belief that the egg white and fig milk mixture functioned as a reinforcement.</span><a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
