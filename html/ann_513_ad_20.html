        <div>
            <p>Since Spring 2015, the Making and Knowing Project’s laboratory
                seminar and the Victoria and Albert Museum/Royal College of Art
                Postgraduate Programme in the History of Design have
                collaborated on researching and reconstructing Ms. Fr. 640’s
                recipes. Students and team members have worked together on
                counterfeit coral, varnishes, and the blue pigment the
                author-practitioner calls “<em>azur</em>.”</p>

    <p>Since Spring 2015, the Making and Knowing Project has collaborated with
        Dr. Marta Ajmar, Dr. Simona Valeriani, and the students of the Victoria
        and Albert Museum/Royal College of Art Postgraduate Programme in the
        History of Design (<a

        to integrate research on Ms. Fr. 640 into the course content of the
        V&amp;A/RCA MA and PhD program.<a href="#fn1"

    <h3 id="section">2015–16</h3>
    <p>In 2015–16, the Making and Knowing Project’s lab seminar students and
        History of Design students had occasional group skype meetings to review
        their respective research and reconstructions.<a href="#fn2"

        student in the History of Design program, researched and wrote an essay

    <h3 id="varnishes">2016–17 Varnishes</h3>
    <p>In 2016–17, in their course module on “Thinking and Experiencing Techne,”
        History of Design students and instructor Dr. Simona Valeriani worked
        with V&amp;A furniture conservators to reconstruct two varnish recipes,
        following instructions in Ms. Fr. 640 on fol. <a

            and next put the drugs inside, and next put them into a vial, &amp;
            apply it on the wood.</p>

    <p><span class="pull-left"></span>These varnish reconstructions replicated
        some of the experiences of Making and Knowing students in reconstructing

    <p>The V&amp;A/RCA students produced a number of blog posts and films about
        these reconstructions, that can be found in the V&amp;A blog under

    <p>Like the Making and Knowing Project students, the V&amp;A/RCA students
        considered reconstruction and authenticity in “Historical Culinary
        Reconstruction” exercises, and, in 2017, when the Making and Knowing
        Project was testing blue pigments to gain insight into the
        author-practitioner’s use of <em>azur</em>,<a href="#fn4"

        worked with Hamilton Kerr conservator, Dr. Spike Bucklow, on the
        grinding of azurite to make a deep blue pigment. See the processes and
