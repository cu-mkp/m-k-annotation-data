<p><span dir="ltr">Table 1 enables us to see the three principal terms used to refer to bread: <em>pain</em>, <em>rostie</em> and <em>ostie</em>. While the first is simply the generic noun “bread,” the other two imply a specific kind of bread, with <em>rostie</em> referring to toast and <em>ostie</em> to the Eucharist of Christian Communion. Table 1 also allows us to see the use of bread in utilitarian and creative contexts, such as feeding birds and training horses, or cleaning printing plates and erasing graphite and ink. Looking closely at bread’s presence in the manuscript also results in a surprising outcome. Short references to specific flours and consistencies begin to complicate the generic term “bread” and raise the deceptively simple question: what is bread? By examining a variety of agricultural, medical, and culinary sources, this essay seeks to answer this question and to explore what role bread played in an artisan’s workshop in late sixteenth-century Toulouse.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Bread is a baked mixture of flour and water, often with yeast and salt added. Already, this rudimentary definition points out the main variable in the recipe: the flour. Far from being solely dictated by availability, the choice of flour depended as much on personal preference—often defined by class norms—as on beliefs and characteristics attributed to different varieties of cereal.</span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Bread from Antiquity through the Early Modern Period</span></strong></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">In the ancient West, bread constituted the primary source of nourishment.</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Indeed, the Greek word <em>sitos</em> and the Hebrew word <em>lehem</em> both carry the general meaning “food” as well as a specific designation for “bread” or “grain.”</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Although the primacy of bread as sustenance was unchallenged, prominent thinkers such as Homer, Aristotle, Pliny, and Galen of Pergamon held strong beliefs regarding the hierarchy of cereals in terms of nourishment. While Homer declared barley meal and wheat flour to be the “marrow of men,” Pliny and Aristotle claimed that although it was the oldest cereal, barley was to be “mostly fed to animals,” with Aristotle professing that wheat is “more nourishing than barley.”</span><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Galen held strong opinions regarding the hierarchy of grains. His extensive study of cereals in <em>On the Powers of Food</em> articulated the principles of a healthy diet, which were adhered to up through the early modern period.</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In order to understand his logic in placing wheat flour above all others, we must suspend our contemporary understanding of the nutritional values of fiber. Indeed, for Galen, the “slowest breads to pass” held the best health benefits.</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> He noted the useful purgative and cooling qualities of barley in treating fevers, and he held the nourishment from barley bread to be “considerable,” though far less than wheat bread.</span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Millet bread to Galen was the “most laxative,” while oats were only to be consumed by humans in times of famine, when they could be made into bread.</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> The best bread for Galen, then, was made from wheat flours, which “possess great power, provided they are digested, and… strongly nourish the body, thereby affording remarkable strength to those who eat them,” but even wheat was subject to a hierarchy.</span><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Indeed, the “most nourishing wheats” were hulled and appeared yellower than “spongier wheats” that contained a lot of bran and were consequently more “purgative.”</span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Additionally, Galen specified the process by which the best bread was to be made, writing that “superior breads from compact and heavy wheats” contained more yeast,</span><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">had been kneaded the most, and had been left to rest between rising and baking.</span><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The best bread was baked in a moderately hot oven, while the easiest to digest was cooked on an earthenware hearth tile on a moderate fire.</span><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Such superior breads were “genuinely white.”</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Baking over a grill or hot ashes, on the other hand, led to a “bad” and “uneven” bread.</span><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Further, Galen forbade using additives such as beans, lentils and peas to make bread, a practice often carried out by the poor in times of scarcity.</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Indeed, this practice continued well into the early modern period. The sixteenth-century author and recipe collector Hugh Plat was interested in foods consumed in times of dearth and recorded various recipes containing additives such as “peas, beans, beech mast, buckwheat, chestnuts, acorns, vetches, arrowroot, turnips, pumpkins, and parsnips.”</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Among Plat’s recipes is one that uses wheat straw to make bread obtained from Bernardino de Mendoza, the Spanish Ambassador to France.</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> This practice of adding various herbs and pulses to bread was common, although also thought to be dangerous. For example, Modenese chronicler Giovan Battista Spaccini reported in 1596 at Ferrara that “it is believed that the cause of many illnesses, of which numerous people even die, is the bad breads which the people eat, namely that of beans, cabbage, and plain oil.”</span><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> This potentially noxious practice was forbidden to bakers, as emerges from a 1592 account from Modena relating how bakers and the judge of provisions were arrested “for having had forty sacks of bay leaf ground to be put in the wheat flour to make bread for the square, where it caused the poverty to those who bought it to worsen, so that for two days there were many people sick enough to go crazy, and during this time they could not work or help their families.”</span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Although the mentions of bread in Ms. Fr. 640 are rather brief, they show an appreciation of the characteristics of different flours. Fol. &lt;29&gt; features a detailed recipe for stucco which specifies that rye flour rather than wheat flour is to be used, as the latter is rougher and less moist when combined into a paste. This reference to the comparative moistness of different flours is already found in Galen, who extols bread’s “moistening” quality for health, but this characteristic was clearly just as relevant to some artisanal practices.</span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Bread in the Urban Realm</span></strong></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Let us turn our attention to the production of bread in early modern Europe. From the multitude of bread varieties available, it is clear that social status played an important role in bread production and consumption, since specialty ovens and the fuel required to heat them made some breads less accessible. For example, <em>manchet</em>, a bread made of the finest white flour and favored by the wealthy in England between 1550 and 1600, required a purpose-built oven that ensured the bricks were evenly heated at a consistent, high temperature.</span><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This was true of leavened, wheat bread in general.</span><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The necessity of an oven excluded a large segment of the population from baking such bread at home, restricting them instead to barley and oat bread, which could be baked in pots in front of the hearth.</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Alternatively, dough could be prepared at home and then taken either to the local baker or to a communal oven to be baked for a fee.</span><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">But even for the lower social classes, bread was not only a matter of cost but also of preference. In Juan Luis Vives’s <em>Dialogues</em>, a set of Latin translation exercises for Vives’s students in Bruges dating to before 1540, a conversation between a group of men highlights different tastes for varying amounts of yeast and water and degrees of sponginess and kneading.</span><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">A preference in grain and baking technique is also evident.</span><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Often, preferences for certain cereals arose regionally. Oats remained consistently popular in northern England, for example, even as the status and popularity of wheat grew.</span><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Preference was to some degree dictated by the availability of grain and flour. In France, the three-field system predominated, in which one field was left fallow to replenish itself, one was planted with a winter grain (wheat or rye), and the third with a spring crop (oats, barley, peas, or beans).</span><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This ensured a constant yield of grains.</span><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This variety is visible in the manuscript, which mentions rye, millet, and also a finer flour that is likely to be wheat. In protoindustrial rural France, merchants hired peasants to process the harvested grains before importing them to urban artisans, who turned them into finished goods.</span><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Toulouse, being a large city, had access to a wide variety of grains coming from the surrounding region, which was one of the most fertile in France.</span><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">From the twelfth to the nineteenth century, Toulouse also featured a <em>halle aux grains</em>, an impressive warehouse for grain, pointing to an abundance of this important staple.</span><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In 1599, the Swiss medical student Thomas Platter noted that Toulouse’s mills were “the most remarkable one could hope to see in all Christendom” and that they could “provide more than enough flour each day for a hundred thousand persons.”</span><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> An official from Toulouse in the early modern period noted that “the people here know no other food than wheat; it would not be possible to make them adopt another.”</span><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> This statement is probably hyperbolic, but it points to the predominance of wheat in Toulouse in this period. Such a preference is also observed in a more general sense by the eighteenth-century French agronomist Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, who observed that “the inhabitants of the cities use a wheaten bread almost exclusively.”</span><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Bakers had the undeniable monopoly on bread production in early modern Europe, a claim supported by the dearth of recipes for bread in cookery books. As early as the thirteenth century, in the <em>Ménagier de Paris</em>, a vernacular French recipe book, the author advises the host that when receiving dinner guests, his wife should purchase ten dozen loaves from the baker, some “day-old, flat, one-penny bread, and three dozen four-day-old brown trencher breads.”</span><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">It is notable that in this earliest of French cookery sources, no recipe for bread is mentioned; instead, the text refers the reader to the baker to obtain bread.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Bakers’ guilds exerted considerable power in France until guilds were abolished in 1791.</span><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In 1640 in Dijon, the bakers, unhappy with their situation, refused to continue working.</span><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The magistrates menaced them with fines and even threatened to destroy their ovens, but ultimately they agreed to a new bread tariff that afforded the bakers a greater profit, a clear indication of the guild’s power.</span><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This is not to say that bakers had unbridled authority in this period. Certainly, the importance of bread as a base staple also made the bakers’ guild one of the most closely regulated craftsmen’s associations in the early modern city.</span><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Various tactics were used to keep fluctuations in the price of grains from affecting the price of bread. In England, the <em>Assize of Bread</em>, a set of laws regulating the size and quality of loaves, dictated that the price per loaf stay constant, adjusting instead the size of the loaf to reflect market cereal prices.</span><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This ensured that poorer citizens could always afford a loaf, even in times when grain supply was low and prices skyrocketed.</span><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In Augsburg, a different approach was used: fine, white wheaten bread was sold at a high price and rye bread at a low one, such that the wealthy subsidized the cost of bread for the poor.</span><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The cost of bread was determined by municipal authorities, unlike other commodities whose prices were set by the artisans themselves.</span><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Consequently, relations between bakers and their local governments were often tense.</span><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">A poem written by a woman about the city’s various craftsmen in sixteenth-century Toulouse indicates through its sardonic tone a similarly strained relationship between the populace and the bakers:</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"><em>Item les gentils Bolengiers,</em> The kind bakers,</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"><em>Qui font leurs pains petiz et legiers,</em> Who make their breads small and light,</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"><em>Affin ne nous facent dangiers,</em> In order that they not cause us danger,</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"><em>Comme chose poisante et utille:</em> As do heavy and useful things:</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"><em>Sont fort&nbsp;loyals en ceste Ville.</em> Are most loyal in this city.</span><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Despite these tensions, bakers’ guilds formed an essential presence in the early modern French city.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The structure of these guilds resembled that of other guilds, with a master baker, apprentices and journeymen constituting the workforce. While many cities did not permit women to be apprentices, in some cities women did work in bakeries, as substantiated in a report of a female baker in the household of Rudolf Dietzinger of Wadenswil (1648–1696/99).</span><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> In the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, guilds required journeymen to travel for a minimum amount of time to work in different cities, a practice called “tramping.”</span><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Bakers, millers, brewers, and butchers usually employed journeymen from rural areas of the surrounding region.</span><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Within bakers’ guilds, the journeymen were known as <em>compagnons</em> or <em>garçons</em>.</span><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>

<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Bread in the Religious Realm</span></strong></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">On fol. 37r, a medicinal recipe to warm the stomach and unstop the liver mentions <em>ostie</em> dipped in wine in combination with wormwood powder and <em>capilli veneris</em>. This medicine is said by the author-practitioner to “[clear] the phlegm and gas.” The use of the word <em>ostie</em>, which would normally be translated as “Host” or “Eucharist,” is intriguing in such a quotidian remedy.</span><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Looking at medieval and early modern Eucharist manufacturing practices, it seems improbable that an <em>ostie</em> would be used in such a recipe.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">A Protestant print mocking the Catholic production of the Eucharist sheds light on what such a practice might have entailed (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 1</span></i>).</span><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> The print depicts the entire process of preparing the Host, from picking the grain to inspecting the final product.

<p><span dir="ltr">Though the production of Hosts was tightly controlled, there are surviving accounts of them being stolen and used outside the realm of the Church. The possibility of “contraband” Hosts making their way into secular spaces such as an artisan’s workshop cannot be excluded and could explain the use of the word <em>ostie</em> in the manuscript. However, an incident that occurred in Normandy in 1627, in which a young shepherd was executed after having kept the consecrated Eucharist in his mouth rather than swallowing it, thereby taking it out of the church, makes clear that the Host and its whereabouts were not taken lightly.</span><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">This incident was far from isolated, as occult practices frequently utilized Hosts.</span><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The existence of a <em>Confrérie du Corpus Christi</em> in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Toulouse, which acted as a regulatory body for the production and dissemination of Hosts, makes the use of an <em>ostie</em> in the recipe to warm the stomach and unstop the liver unlikely.</span><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">Even if the medicinal recipe on fol. &lt;37r&gt; was unlikely to have required an actual Host, we might still ponder whether the term <em>ostie</em> carried a religious significance, especially as it appears with wine. This recipe can be compared with another medicinal recipe on fol. &lt;103r&gt;, in which reciting the pater noster nine times serves as an indication of the time one must stir the mixture and may also have had spiritual significance. Nevertheless, we should not exclude the possibility that <em>ostie</em> is used not to designate a Host <em>per se</em> but an unleavened bread.</span><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Given its medicinal context, the use of the term <em>ostie</em> might allude to the fact that the carrier for the wormwood and <em>capilli veneris</em> should be a simple mixture of flour and water, a mixture that the word Host conveys. Knowing the religious affinity of the author-practitioner would be of use in speculating the likelihood that he would use a word designating the all-important Catholic sacrament to colloquially refer to a sort of cracker.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">The orthographic similarity of <em>ostie</em> and <em>rostie</em> and the fact that each only appears in the manuscript once (in preventive and curative functions) raises the question of whether they might refer to the same thing, namely a sort of cracker or toast. Is the “r” in <em>rostie</em> a slip of the pen, or, conversely, is <em>ostie</em> missing its first letter? Jean Nicot’s <em>Thresor de la Langue Française</em> from 1606 defines <em>rostie</em> simply as “<em>panis tostus</em>,” or toasted bread.</span><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The use of <em>rostie</em> in a preventive medicinal context on fol. &lt;79v&gt;, where it is prescribed to be eaten with butter to prevent the entry of the smoke of metals into the body, is akin to the use of <em>ostie</em> in the curative recipe on fol. &lt;37r&gt;. The shared medicinal context perhaps supports thinking of the latter as a misspelling of the former. A cursory search for “<em>ostie</em>” on Gallica failed to identify other instances of the word being used within the domestic and medicinal realm. Further research on the use of the word <em>ostie</em> in secular contexts would therefore be useful.</span></p>
<p><span dir="ltr"></span></p>
<p><strong><span dir="ltr">Bread in the Workshop</span></strong></p>
<p><span dir="ltr">By way of conclusion, and with this rich historical web of bread in mind, we can now turn to the question of how bread entered the workshop of the author-practitioner. The prominence of bakers’ guilds in France in the period makes the bakery a likely source for the bread used in the manuscript’s recipes. However, as has been argued above, we must not dismiss domestic baking practices, tasks that predominantly fell to the wife of the household. The common practice of dispensing bread as payment in kind to workshop employees might also support a domestic provenance.</span><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The physical proximity of the workshop to the kitchen might have blurred functional distinctions between these two spaces in the early modern period.</span><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Specifically in Toulouse, the <em>capitouls</em>, the city’s chief magistrates, gave bread to artisans, which may also be a source for the bread in the manuscript.</span><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a> <span dir="ltr"> Another possibility, which some of the language in the manuscript corroborates, is that bread was baked in the workshop itself. Indeed, references on fols. &lt;84r&gt;, &lt;129v&gt; and &lt;130r&gt; to carrying out tasks in the mouth of the oven after bread has been taken out, an indication of the temperature desired for these tasks, suggests the possibility of baking bread in the workshop. Additionally, the resemblance in visual sources between bakers’ ovens (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 3</span></i>) and metalworkers’ ovens (<i><span class="underline">Fig. 4</span></i>) supports this possibility.</span><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">The recipe for “Preparing sand for box molds” on fol. &lt;161r&gt; explicitly mentions a “bread oven.” This reference may suggest that a metalworker’s oven could also serve as a bread oven. Indeed, many sources describe a domed oven as being best for baking bread.</span><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">Clearly, bread was ubiquitous, and our task in determining its source is made difficult not so much by the lack of textual evidence but by the abundance of contexts in which bread was baked during this period.</span></p><div class="figure-container"><figure><img src="http://localhost:4000/bnf-ms-fr-640/images/ann_046_fa_16/0BwJi-u8sfkVDUEFmQWVYYjJlcUU.jpg" alt="fig. 3"><figcaption><span dir="ltr">Fig. 3.

<p><span dir="ltr">What this preliminary study of the world of baking in early modern Toulouse has demonstrated is the pervasive and diverse presence of bread.</span><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a> <span dir="ltr">In the manuscript, concise and scattered allusions to bread support an understanding of this material as something both ubiquitous and highly particular. The category of “bread” is characterized by diversity, from fine wheaten loaves baked in specialized ovens and rustic oat breads cooked before the fire to amalgams of various pulses and unrefined cereal flours consolidated into a dense dough. Although the author-practitioner does not elaborate on his particular understanding of bread, occasional references to specific flours demonstrate his awareness of their different properties. This merits further research to elucidate the context of bread in Toulouse. Nevertheless, this introductory study helps us imagine the context for the author-practitioner’s use of bread in his workshop.</span></p>

<li id="fn13" role="doc-endnote"><p><span dir="ltr">While Galen claimed that “whatever is completely without yeast is of use to no one,” he did find benefits to yeast-less wheat wafers, which, although they could “obstruct the... liver,” cause “a weak spleen,” and “[produce] stones in the kidneys,” they were nonetheless “slow to pass” and “reasonably nourishing, if … converted into blood properly.” Indeed, Galen believed bread made “strong firm flesh,” and emphasized the relationship between the “finest bread” and the “best blood.” According to the Galenic theory of concoction, food in the stomach was transformed into chyle, which the liver converted to the four humors, which then nourished the rest of the body, replenishing the flesh and organs. Consequently, excessive eating could lead to bad humors resulting in corporeal deterioration.

This essay could not address the numerous mentions of specific flours (43 references to wheat, 2 to rye, 9 to millet, and 1 each to oat and barley) in the manuscript, which merit a closer look. The frequency of references to wheat support my hypothesis that the bread used in the manuscript is wheat bread. Additionally, the fact that the second most commonly named grain is millet is not coincidental, given the presence of a recipe for <em>millas</em> in the manuscript and the popularity of such millet bread in Toulouse.
